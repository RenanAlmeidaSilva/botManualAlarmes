2000 PLC sign-of-life monitoring
Explanation: The PLC must give a sign of life within a defined period of time (MD10100 $MN_PLC_CYCLIC_TIMEOUT). If this does
not occur, the alarm is triggered.
The sign of life is a counter reading on the internal NC/PLC interface which the PLC causes to count up with the 10 ms
time alarm. The NCK also tests cyclically whether the counter reading has changed.
The PLC must give a sign of life within a defined period of time. If this does not occur, this alarm is triggered.

4000 [Channel %1: ] Machine data %2[%3] has gap in axis assignment
Parameters: %1 = Channel number
%2 = String: MD identifier
Explanation: The assignment of a machine axis to a channel by the MD20070 $MC_AXCONF_MACHAX_USED must be contiguous.
At system power-up (Power On) gaps are detected and displayed as an alarm.
Reaction: NC not ready.
Mode group not ready, also effective for single axes.
NC Start disable in this channel.

Remedy: Please inform the authorized personnel/service department. The entries for the indices for the machine axes used in the
channels must be contiguous in table MD20070 $MC_AXCONF_MACHAX_USED. Channel axis gaps must be enabled
via MD11640$MN_ENABLE_CHAN_AX_GAP.
Please inform the authorized personnel/service department.
Configure MD20070 $MC_AXCONF_MACHAX_USED so that axes are assigned to channels without any gaps. This
means that, as the channel axis index increases, a machine axis must be assigned to each channel until a zero is entered
for the first time (no machine axis). A 0 then also has to be entered for all higher indices in the MD.
The order of the machine axis numbers is irrelevant.

4001 [Channel %1: ] Axis %2 defined for more than one channel via machine data %3
Parameters: %1 = Channel number

%3 = String: MD identifier
Explanation: In the channel-specific MD20070 $MC_AXCONF_MACHAX_USED [CHn, AXm]=x (n ... channel number, m ... channel
axis number, x ... machine axis number), several channels were assigned to a machine axis without having a master
channel defined for this axis.
There is usually not much point in assigning a machine axis to several channels. In exceptional cases, multiple assignment
can be performed if a master channel is defined for this axis. The channel assignment can be performed in accordance
with the machining requirements in the NC part program by means of a keyword (yet to be defined in later product versions).

Explanation: For some applications, it is useful to operate an axis in several channels (C axis or spindle on single spindle or double
carriage machines).
The machine axes which are defined through the channel-specific MD20070 $MC_AXCONF_MACHAX_USED in several

4005 [Channel %1: ] Maximum number of axes is exceeded. Limit %2
Parameters: %1 = Channel number
%2 = Upper limit for the number of axes in the channel
Explanation: MD20070 $MC_AXCONF_MACHAX_USED defines which machine axes can be used in this channel. This simultaneously
defines the number of active axes in the channel. This upper limit has been exceeded. Note: The channel axis gaps may
cause certain indices of MD20070 $MC_AXCONF_MACHAX_USED to remain unused and therefore do not count as active
channel axes.
Example:
- CHANDATA(2)
- $MC_AXCONF_MACHAX_USED[0] = 7
- $MC_AXCONF_MACHAX_USED[1] = 8
- $MC_AXCONF_MACHAX_USED[2] = 0
- $MC_AXCONF_MACHAX_USED[3] = 3
- $MC_AXCONF_MACHAX_USED[4] = 2
- $MC_AXCONF_MACHAX_USED[5] = 0
- $MC_AXCONF_MACHAX_USED[6] = 1
- $MC_AXCONF_MACHAX_USED[7] = 0

4070 Normalizing machine data has been changed
Explanation: The control uses internal physical units (mm, degrees, s, for paths, velocities, acceleration, etc.). During programming or
data storage, some of these values are input and output using different units (rev./min, m/s2, etc.).
The conversion is carried out with the scaling factors that can be entered (system-spefic MD array MD10230
$MN_SCALING_FACTORS_USER_DEF USER_DEF[n] (n ... index number 0 - 10), when the corresponding masking bit
is set to "1".
If the masking bit is set to "0" then scaling takes place with the internal standard factors.
The following machine data influence the scaling of other MDs:
MD10220: $MN_SCALING_USER_DEF_MASK
MD10230: $MN_SCALING_FACTORS_USER_DEF
MD10240: $MN_SCALING_SYSTEM_IS_METRIC
MD10250: $MN_SCALING_VALUE_INCH

If these data are modified, the NCK must be powered up again. Only then will the input of dependent data be performed
correctly.
Reaction: Alarm display.
Remedy: Please inform the authorized personnel/service department.

4077 New value %1 of MD %2 not set. Requested %3 bytes too much %4 memory.
Parameters: %1 = New value of machine data
%2 = Machine data number
%3 = Number of bytes requested that exceeded availability
%4 = Type of memory
Explanation: An attempt was made to enter a new value in the specified memory configuration machine data. It was not possible to
modify the value, as this would have cleared the contents of the user memory. This was because the memory requested
exceeded the available capacity.
The third parameter specifies the number of bytes by which the maximum user memory was exceeded.
The fourth parameter specifies the type of memory whose limit was exceeded.
- "D" stands for dynamic or non-buffered user memory (this is where, for example, the LUD variables are stored and the
interpolation buffer size is entered). The capacity of this memory type is defined by the current memory configuration and
the value in MD18210 $MN_MM_USER_MEM_DYNAMIC.
- "S" stands for static or buffered user memory (this is where part programs, offset data, R variables, tool data, etc. are
stored). This memory type is defined by the current memory configuration and the value in MD18230
$MN_MM_USER_MEM_BUFFERED.
- "iS" stands for internal static or buffered user memory. This memory type is defined by the current memory configuration
(not settable). A few NCK functions use this memory.
Reaction: Alarm display.

42 Diagnostics Manual, 01/2015, 6FC5398-6BP40-5BA2
Remedy: If the modification was unintentional, ignore the error message and continue. The alarm has no negative effects. The
remedy depends on the access right and the current memory configuration of the NCK:
- The intended change is not possible -> Try again with a smaller value. Observe the change in the number of bytes.
- Is it possible to expand the memory? This option depends on the model in use. (Not possible if parameter 4 equals "iS").
- The NCK user memory may have been set smaller than it could be. With the appropriate access authorization, the
machine data (see above) can be changed.
- If parameter 4 equals "iS" and no synchronous actions are used, then MD18232
$MN_MM_ACTFILESYS_LOG_FILE_MEM[2] = 0 can be set. Otherwise the desired machine data change cannot be made.

4345 [Channel %1: ] Invalid configuration in chained transformation no. %2
Parameters: %1 = Channel number
%2 = Transformation number
Explanation: A chained transformation is incorrectly configured (MD24995 $MC_TRACON_CHAIN_1 or MD24996
$MC_TRACON_CHAIN_2). The following causes for the error are possible:
- The list of transformations to be chained starts with a 0 (at least one entry not equal to zero is required).
- The list of transformations to be chained contains the number of a transformation which does not exist.
- The number of a transformation in the list is greater than or equal to the number of the chained transformation. Example:
The cascaded transformation is the fourth transformation in the system, i.e. MD24400 $MC_TRAFO_TYPE_4 = 8192. In
this case, only values 1, 2 or 3 may be entered in the associated list (e.g. MD24995 $MC_TRACON_CHAIN_1[...]).
- The chaining setting is invalid. The following restrictions currently apply. A maximum of two transformations can be
chained. The first transformation must be an orientation transformation, transmit, peripheral curve transformation or inclined
axis. The second transformation must be the inclined axis transformation.

5000 Communication job not executable %1
Parameters: %1 = Reference to which resources are no longer available.
Explanation: The communication job (data exchange between NCK and HMI, e.g.: loading an NC part program) cannot be executed
because there is insufficient memory space. Cause: too many communication jobs in parallel.
Reaction: Alarm display.
Remedy: - Reduce the number of communication jobs taking place at the same time or increase MD10134

6000 Memory reorganized using standard machine data
Explanation: The memory management was not able to allocate the NC user memory with the values in the machine data. It did not
have enough memory available because the total memory available is provided as dynamic and static memory for the NC
user (e.g. for macro definitions, user variables, number of tool offsets, number of directories and files etc.).
Reaction: NC not ready.
Mode group not ready, also effective for single axes.
NC Start disable in this channel.
Interface signals are set.
Alarm display.
NC Stop on alarm.
Remedy: Redefine the NC memory structure!
A specific MD for NC user memory allocation cannot be stated to be the cause of the alarm. The MD initiating the alarm
therefore has to be determined on the basis of the default values in the machine data by changing the user-specific memory
structure step by step.
Usually, it is not just one single MD that has been set too large. Therefore it is advisable to reduce the memory area by a
certain proportion in several MDs.

66 Diagnostics Manual, 01/2015, 6FC5398-6BP40-5BA2
Explanation: Data management has detected an error during ramp-up. The specified data block may not have been created. The error
number specifies the type of error. An error number >100000 indicates a fatal system error. Other error numbers indicate
that the user memory area provided is too small. In this case the (user) error numbers have the following meaning:
- Error number 1: No memory space available
- Error number 2: Maximum possible number of symbols exceeded
- Error number 3: Index 1 lies outside the valid value range
- Error number 4: Name already exists in channel
- Error number 5: Name already exists in NCK
If the alarm occurs after cycle programs, macro definitions or definitions for global user data (GUD) have been introduced,
the machine data for the user memory configuration has been configured incorrectly. In all other cases, changes to machine
data that is already correct lead to errors in the user memory configuration.

6035 Instead of %1 KB the system has only %2 KB of free user memory of type '%3'
Parameters: %1 = Free memory capacity in KB defined for the control model
%2 = Actual maximum capacity of free memory in KB
%3 = Type of memory, "D" =non-battery-backed, "S" =battery-backed
Explanation: The alarm can only occur after a 'cold start' (=NCK start-up with standard machine data). The alarm is only a notice. There
is no interference with any NCK functions. It shows that the NCK has less free user memory available than specified by
Siemens for this control variant. The value of the actually available free user memory can also be taken from the MD18050
$MN_INFO_FREE_MEM_DYNAMIC, MD18060 $MN_INFO_FREE_MEMS_STATIC.
Siemens supplies NCK with default settings that, depending on the model, have certain (free) memory space available for
the specific settings of the actual applications. The original factory setting of NCK systems is thus that the alarm does not
occur with a cold start.
Reaction: Alarm display.
Remedy: Reasons for the message:
- The NCK contains compile cycle software, that uses so much memory space that the hardware cannot provide the
required memory.
- The NCK runs on hardware that is not intended for this NCK release (i.e. that has not enough memory capacity).
- If the application runs properly with the remaining free user memory (i.e. can be setup without any errors), the message
can simply be ignored.
- If the actual application cannot be configured because there is not enough memory capacity available, either the existing
compile cycle must be reduced or, if possible, the system must be upgraded with additional memory space.

Parameters: %1 = Channel ID
%2 = String (identifier)
%3 = -Not used-
%4 = Magazine number
Explanation: The tool cannot be moved into the selected tool magazine. There is no appropriate location for this tool. A suitable location
is mainly determined by the status. The status must indicate that this location is free, not disabled, not reserved and not
co-occupied by a tool that is too large. Furthermore, it is important that the type of tool matches the type of any magazine
location that may be free. (If, for example, all magazine locations are of the 'B' type and these are all free and the tool is
of type 'A', then this tool cannot be put into this magazine).

Explanation: The specified command has been answered by the PLC with an invalid acknowledgement in the current context. The
following assignments are defined for "command no.":
1 Move tool, load or unload magazine
2 Prepare tool change
3 Execute tool change
4 Prepare tool change and execute with T command
5 Prepare tool change and execute with M command
7 Terminate canceled tool command
8 Check tool movement with reservation
9 Check tool movement
0 Transport acknowledgement
Parameters 2 and 3 designate the PLC command and the status number of the acknowledgement.
Example: Parameter 4 of the alarm message is 10. It is not defined that a buffer location has to be reserved for
asynchronous tool motion. In the example, the parameter is ignored by the NCK. Further possible causes for the alarm:
The tool change defined by the command is not possible. The magazine location specified in the invalid parameter does
not exist in the magazine.
The 3rd parameter - error identification - gives a more detailed description of the alarm. Meanings:
- 0 = not defined
- 1 = status not allowed or undefined status received by PLC
- 2 = source and/or target magazine no./location no. unknown
- 3 = not defined
- 4 = target magazine no. and/or location no. are not the end target in the tool motion command
- 5 = not defined
- 6 = source and/or target magazine no./location no. unknown during tool change
- 7 = PLC comm. with inconsistent data: either inconsistent magazine addresses in VDI or NCK command unequal to PLC
acknowledgement or both
- 8 = PLC comm. with inconsistent data: while rejecting a tool, the tool to be rejected was unloaded asynchronously. NCK
cannot perform a new selection.
- 9 = PLC comm. with inconsistent data: the command acknowledgement data wants to move a tool to a location that is
occupied by another tool.
- 10 = Asynchronous tool motion with reservation is only defined for the motion from a magazine to a buffer location.
- 11 = The replaced tool is within a multi-tool. PLC must not acknowledge the multi-tool position defined by the NCK with
another value.

Explanation: The desired tool motion command - triggered from the MMC or PLC - is not possible. A movement request was issued to
put the tool in a location which does not satisfy the prerequisites for filling.
The following causes for the error are possible:
- Location is blocked or not free!
- Tool type does not match the location type!
- Tool possibly too large, adjacent locations are not free!
- If a tool is to be loaded or unloaded, the load/unload position must be of 'load location' type.
- If a tool is to be loaded or unloaded, is the magazine in question linked to the load/unload location?

6430 Workpiece counter: overflow in table of monitored cutting edges.
Explanation: No more cutting edges can be entered in the piece counter table.
As many cutting edges can be noted for the workpiece counter as are possible in total in the NCK.
This means that if for each tool each cutting edge in each TO unit is used precisely once for a workpiece then the limit is
reached.
If several workpieces are made on several toolholders/spindles simultaneously, it is possible to note
MD18100 $MN_MM_NUM_CUTTING_EDGES_IN_TOA cutting edges for the workpiece counter for all of the workpieces.
If this alarm occurs, it means that cutting edges used subsequently are no longer quantity monitored until the table has
been emptied again, e.g. by means of the NC language command SETPIECE or by the relevant job from HMI, PLC (PI
service).
Reaction: NC Start disable in this channel.
Interface signals are set.
Alarm display.
Remedy: - Was decrementing of the piece counter forgotten? Then program SETPIECE in the part program, or add the correct
command in the PLC program.
- If the part program/PLC program is correct, then more memory should be set for tool cutting edges via the MD18100
$MN_MM_NUM_CUTTING_EDGES_IN_TOA (can only be performed with the necessary access rights!).

6442 [Channel %1: ] Function not executable. No tool assigned to desired magazine/magazine location
%2.
Parameters: %1 = Channel ID
%2 = Magazine/magazine location no.
Explanation: PLC logic is presumably incorrect. Tool change with reject tool is configured. Preparatory command is pending. Selected
tool is (e.g. from PLC) unloaded from its location. PLC acknowledges preparatory command with 'Repeat tool selection'
(e.g. status =7). NCK cannot find the tool at the magazine location specified in the PLC command.
Or: Illegal operator intervention in an active tool selection (unloading of the tool to be selected) has occurred. Therefore
the PLC acknowledgement fails.
Reaction: Interface signals are set.
Alarm display.
Remedy: PLC programmer must note the following:
- Ensure that the tool is not removed from the specified magazine location (e.g. incorrect PLC program).
- Do not remove the tool from the programmed tool change before the final acknowledgement of the command (= unload).
!! It is however permissible to change the location of the tool to be loaded. The NCK can deal with this situation.
This alarm supplements Alarm 6405, if it contains the identifier 8. Therefore, the diagnostics should be easier.

Diagnostics Manual, 01/2015, 6FC5398-6BP40-5BA2 103
Remedy: Please inform the authorized personnel/service department. Via the channel-specific MD20700:
$MC_REFP_NC_START_LOCK (NC Start without reference point) you can decide whether or not the axis has to be
referenced before NC Start. The start of referencing can be enabled channel-specific or axis-specific.
Channel-specific reference point approach: The rising edge of the NC/PLC interface signal DB21-30 DBX1.0 (Activate
referencing) starts an automatic sequence which starts the axes of the channel in the same sequence as specified in the
axis-specific MD34110 $MA_REFP_CYCLE_NR (axis sequence channel-specific referencing). 0: The axis does not
participate in channel-specific referencing, but it must be referenced for NC Start, -1: The axis does not participate in
channel-specific referencing, but it need not be referenced for NC Start, 1- 8: Starting sequence for the channel-specific
referencing (simultaneous start at the same no.), 1 - 31: CPU type

Remedy: Please reference the axis that needs to be referenced.
If the user action as an internal action leads to an NC start, whether or not the axis has to be referenced before NC start

the user action as internal actions leads to a user ASUB start, whether or not the axis has to be referenced before ASUB
start can be decided via the channel-specific MD20115 $MC_IGNORE_REFP_LOCK_ASUP (ASUB start without reference
point). If the user action as internal actions leads to a Prog Event start, whether or not the axis has to be referenced before
Prog Event start can be decided via the channel-specific MD20105 $MC_PROG_EVENT_IGN_REFP_LOCK (Prog Event
start without reference point).
Channel or axis-specific referencing can be triggered.
Please inform the authorized personnel/service department. Whether or not the axis has to be referenced before NC start

Parameters: %1 = Channel number

Explanation: The cutter radius compensation must buffer a variable number of intermediate blocks in order to enable calculation of the
equidistant tool path for each NC block. The size of the buffer cannot be determined by simple means. It depends on the
number of blocks without traversing information in the compensation plane, the number of contour elements to be inserted
and the shape of the curvature in spline and polynomial interpolation.
The size of the buffer is fixed by the system and cannot be changed via the MDs.

current starting point
Parameters: %1 = Channel number
%2 = Block number, label
Explanation: When activating the cutter radius compensation with KONT the starting point of the approach block is within the
compensation circle and therefore already violates the contour.
If the cutter radius compensation is selected with G41/G42, the approach behavior (NORM or KONT) determines the
compensation movement if the present actual position is behind the contour. With KONT, a circle is drawn with the cutter
radius around the programmed initial point (= end point of the approach block). The tangent that passes through the current
actual position and does not violate the contour is the approach movement.
If the start point is within the compensation circle around the target point, no tangent passes through this point.

126 Diagnostics Manual, 01/2015, 6FC5398-6BP40-5BA2
Explanation: On deselection of the cutter radius compensation, the programmed end point is within the compensation circle. If this point
were in fact to be approached without compensation, there would be a contour violation.
If the cutter radius compensation is deselected via G40, the approach behavior (NORM or KONT) determines the
compensation movement if the programmed end point is behind the contour. With KONT, a circle is drawn with the cutter
radius about the last point at which the compensation is still active. The tangent passing through the programmed end
position and not violating the contour is the retraction movement.
If the start point is within the compensation circle around the target point, no tangent passes through this point.

Explanation: In a block with spline or polynomial interpolation, the corrected path runs in at least one point parallel to the tool orientation,
i.e. the path has a tangent perpendicular to the compensation plane.
The tangent at a point on a path is regarded as parallel to the tool orientation if the angle between the two directions is
less than the limit value defined by MD21080 $MC_CUTCOM_PARALLEL_ORI_LIMIT.
However, in circumferential milling, straight lines running parallel to the tool orientation are permissible, as well as circles
with a circle plane perpendicular to the compensation plane (application with smooth retraction from the groove).

10761 [Channel %1: ] Block %2 tool radius compensation for ellipse with more than one revolution not

Parameters: %1 = Channel number

Explanation: When machining the inside of an ellipse, in parts of the ellipse the curvature radii are greater than or smaller than the cutter
radius compensation.
In ellipses, in this case the block would be split up into 4 subblocks with curvature radii that are greater than and less than
the compensation radius. Over several revolutions, there would be a tremendous increase in the amount of calculation
required by the unlimited number of resulting subblocks, and therefore this situation is rejected by the error message.
If compensation is possible everywhere or nowhere on the ellipse, then ellipses are also permissible that cover more than
one full revolution.

10768 [Channel %1: ] Block %2 illegal tool orientation with 3D tool radius compensation
Parameters: %1 = Channel number
%2 = Block number, label
Explanation: This alarm may occur during 3D face milling: the angle between the surface normal vector of the surface to be machined
and the largest surface normal vector of the tool surface is smaller than the limit value given by MD21080
$MC_CUTCOM_PARALLEL_ORI_LIMIT, or the tool is oriented such that machining would have to be performed from the
rear side of the surface. In this case, the largest surface normal vector is the vector the direction of which deviates most
from the direction in the tool point (i.e. parallel to the tool longitudinal axis).
With cylindrical tools or tools which end in a cylindrical part (e.g. the standard torus milling cutter), this vector is positioned
perpendicular to the tool vector. For this type of tool, the alarm indicates that the angle between the tool longitudinal axis
of, for example an envelope line of the cylinder, and the surface to be machined is smaller than the minimum permissible
value. With tools the (valid) surface of which ends in a tapered part instead of a cylindrical part (e.g. a beveled cutter or a
torus milling cutter where the torus is defined to be smaller than 90 degrees), this alarm indicates that the angle between
an envelope line of the taper and the surface to be machined is smaller than the minimum permissible value.

they must be at 90° to one another. Since both vectors can be programmed independently of each other, deviations from

a contour consisting of two straight lines is to be programmed with angles, it is possible to specify the two axis positions
of the plane and an angle in the second block. The error can also occur if, due to a programming error, the preceding block
cannot be interpreted as the first subblock of such a contour. A block is interpreted as the first block of a two-block contour
if an angle, but not an axis of the active plane, was programmed, and if the block is not already the second block of a

10800 [Channel %1: ] Block %3 axis %2 is not a geometry axis
Parameters: %1 = Channel number
%2 = Axis name, spindle number
%3 = Block number, label
Explanation: With an active transformation or a frame with a rotation component the geometry axes are needed for block preparation.
If a geometry axis has previously been traversed as positioning axis, it retains its status of "positioning axis" until it is again
programmed as a geometry axis.
Because of the POSA motion beyond block boundaries, it is not possible to identify in the preprocessing run whether the
axis has already reached its target position when the block is executed. This is, however, an unconditional requirement
for calculating the ROT component of the frame or of the transformation.
If geometry axes are used as positioning axes, then:
1. No rotation may be specified in the current overall frame.
2. No transformation may be selected.
Reaction: Correction block is reorganized.

Explanation: Cause:
A traversing velocity has not been programmed for the displayed traversing block.

With modal traversing velocity FRCM defined for rounding RND or chamfering CHF, feed FRCM was not reprogrammed
after the feed type changed, for example linear feed G94 after revolutional feedrate G95, or revolutional feedrate G95 F
after tooth feedrate G95 FZ.
Note:
Feed FRCM also has to be reprogrammed when the feed type changes if the current traversing block does not contain

- The programmed contour characteristic is very uneven.
- The FGROUP definition is unfavorable relative to the contour.
- The setting MD28530 $MC_MM_PATH_VELO_SEGMENTS=0 is inadequate for curvature changes occurring within one
block. This problem occurs more frequently with G643, G644 and COMPCAD.
- A kinematic transformation has been implemented with insufficient numerical accuracy.
The path velocity is generally reduced substantially in order to avoid axis overloads safely. An apparent machine standstill
may occur. Severe axis movements occur suddenly as soon as the singular position is reached.
Reaction: Alarm display.
Warning display.
Remedy: Dividing a block into several smaller ones often provides an improvement.
If MD28530 $MC_MM_PATH_VELO_SEGMENTS=0 is set, then the alarm may be avoidable by a value MD28530
$MC_MM_PATH_VELO_SEGMENTS=3 or 5, as the blocks are then analyzed considerably more accurately.

10912 [Channel %1: ] Block %2 preprocessing and main run might not be synchronized
Parameters: %1 = Channel number
%2 = Block number, label
Explanation: The preset positioning axis run cannot be accurately calculated beforehand. The reason for this is either that the axes
involved in the transformation are traversed as positioning axes or that a transformation pole is circumnavigated too
frequently by the curve.
The velocity check is performed starting from this block in the main run. It is more conservative than with anticipated
calculation. The LookAhead function is deactivated. If it is not possible to take over the velocity check into the main run,
part program processing is canceled.
Reaction: Alarm display.
Remedy: No action is usually necessary. The velocity control operates more effectively, however, if the part program is modified.
- If a transformation pole is circumnavigated several times by the curve, it helps to split up the block into smaller parts.
- If a positioning axis is the cause, you should check whether the axis can be traversed as a path axis. The Look Ahead
function remains deactivated until preprocessing can be based on defined conditions again (e.g. as a result of change
from JOG->AUTO, tool or tool edge change).

10914 [Channel %1: ] Block %2: movement not possible while transformation active.
Parameters: %1 = Channel number

Explanation: The machine kinematics does not allow the specified motion. Transformation-dependent error causes can be in:
TRANSMIT: A (circular) area exists around the pole, where positioning is not possible. The area is caused by the fact that
the tool reference point cannot be traversed as far as into the pole.
The area is defined by:
- the machine data (MD24920 $MC_TRANSMIT_BASE_TOOL..)
- the active tool length compensation (see $TC_DP..). Whether the tool length compensation is included in the calculation
depends on the working plane selected (see G17,..).
- The machine stops before the faulty block.

Explanation: Some keywords require that the data in their parameters be written in variables of the type "AXIS". For example, in the
keyword PO the axis identifier must be specified in the parenthesized expression, and it must be defined as a variable of
the AXIS type. With the following keywords only parameters of the AXIS type are possible:
AX[..], FA[..], FD[..], FL[..], IP[..], OVRA[..], PO[..], POS[..], POSA[..]
Example:
N5 DEF INT ZUSTELL=Z1 incorrect, this does not specify an axis identifier but the number 26 161
N5 DEF AXIS ZUSTELL=Z1 correct
 :
N10 POLY PO[X]=(0.1,0.2,0.3) PO[Y]=(22,33,44) &PO[INFEED]=(1,2,3)

12164 [Channel %1: ] Block %2 access protection programmed more than once %3
Parameters: %1 = Channel number
%2 = Block number, label
%3 = Duplicate protection level programming
Explanation: The language commands APW and APR are used to program access protection for access to both the part program and
the OPI. APWP and APRP define access protection from the part program; APWB and APRB define access protection
via the OPI. Programming APW in the same block together with APWP or APWB or programming APR in the same block
together with APRP or APRB will lead to a conflict, as the protection level assignment is no longer unique.
Reaction: Correction block is reorganized.
Interface signals are set.
Alarm display.
Remedy: If access protection in the part program and on the OPI needs to be set to diffferent levels, only the language commands
APWP, APWB, APRP and APRB may be used. If access protection is to be the same in the part program and on the OPI,
it can also be programmed with APW or APR, although in this case the APWP and APWB or APRP und APRB commands

12300 [Channel %1: ] Block %2 call-by-reference parameter missing on subroutine call %3
Parameters: %1 = Channel number
%2 = Block number, label
%3 = Source string
Explanation: In the subroutine definition, a formal REF parameter (call-by-reference parameter) has been specified with no actual
parameter assigned to it.
The assignment takes place in the subroutine call on the basis of the position of the variable name and not on the basis
of the name!
Example:
Subroutine: (2 call-by-value parameters X and Y,
 1 call-by-reference parameter Z)
PROC XYZ (INT X, INT Y, VAR INT Z)
 :
M17
ENDPROC
Main program:
N10 DEF INT X
N11 DEF INT Y

12310 [Channel %1: ] Block %2 axis parameter missing on procedure call %3
Parameters: %1 = Channel number
%2 = Block number, label
%3 = Source string
Explanation: When calling the subroutine, an AXIS parameter is missing which, according to the EXTERN declaration, should be present.
With the EXTERN instruction, user-defined subroutines (procedures) are made "known" that have a parameter transfer.
Procedures without parameter transfer require no EXTERN declaration.
Example:
Subroutine XYZ (with the formal parameters):
PROC XYZ (INT X, VAR INT Y, AXIS A, AXIS B)
EXTERN instruction (with variable types):
EXTERN XYZ (INT, VAR INT, AXIS, AXIS) Subroutine call (with actual parameters):
N10 XYZ (, Y1, R_TISCH)
Variable X is defaulted with value 0
Variable Y is supplied with the value of the variable Y1 and returns the results to the calling program after the subroutine
run
Variable A is supplied with the axis in R_TISCH
Variable B missing!

12330 [Channel %1: ] Block %2 type of parameter %3 incorrect
Parameters: %1 = Channel number
%2 = Block number, label
%3 = Source string
Explanation: When calling a procedure (a subroutine) it is found that the type of the actual parameter cannot be converted into the type
of the formal parameter. There are two possible cases:
- Call-by-reference parameter: Actual parameter and formal parameter must be of precisely the same type, e.g. STRING,
STRING.
- Call-by-value parameter: Actual parameter and formal parameter can in principle be different providing conversion is
basically possible. In the present case, however, the types are generally not compatible, e.g. STRING -> REAL.
Overview of type conversions:
- from REAL to: REAL: yes, INT: yes*, BOOL: yes1), CHAR: yes*, STRING: -, AXIS: -, FRAME: -
- from INT to: REAL: yes, INT: yes, BOOL: yes1), CHAR: if value 0 ...255, STRING: -, AXIS: -, FRAME: -
- from BOOL to: REAL: yes, INT: yes, BOOL: yes, CHAR: yes, STRING: -, AXIS: -, FRAME: -
- from CHAR to: REAL: yes, INT: yes, BOOL: yes1), CHAR: yes, STRING: yes, AXIS: -, FRAME: -
- from STRING to: REAL: -, INT: -, BOOL: yes2), CHAR: only if 1 character, STRING: yes, AXIS: -, FRAME: -
- from AXIS to: REAL: -, INT: -, BOOL: -, CHAR: -, STRING: -, AXIS: yes, FRAME: -
- from FRAME to: REAL: -, INT: -, BOOL: -, CHAR: -, STRING: -, AXIS: -, FRAME: yes
1) Value <> 0 corresponds to TRUE, value ==0 corresponds to FALSE.
2) String length 0 => FALSE, otherwise TRUE.
*) At type conversion from REAL to INT fractional values that are >=0.5 are rounded up, others are rounded down.
Reaction: Correction block is reorganized.

12350 [Channel %1: ] Block %2 parameter %3 no longer possible
Parameters: %1 = Channel number
%2 = Block number, label
%3 = Source string
Explanation: An attempt has been made to transfer actual parameters although axis parameters located before them have not been
assigned. For procedure or function calls, the assignment of parameters that are no longer required can be omitted if no
more parameters are to be transferred subsequently. Example: N10 FGROUP(X, Y, Z, A, B); a max. of 8 axes possible
The following call-by-value parameters would then be initialized with zero because the space-dependent assignment has
been lost on account of the missing axis parameters. Axes that can be omitted and following parameters do not occur in
the predefined procedures and functions.
Reaction: Correction block is reorganized.

the active part program than allowed by the MD).
GUD data blocks can cause errors as part of the 'initial.ini download' process (e.g. in the case of a series start-up) or by
selective activation via PI service _N_F_COPY (activate GUD via HMI dialog). If alarm 15180 refers to a GUD definition
file, then MD18120 $MN_MM_NUM_GUD_NAMES_NCK or MD18130 $MN_MM_NUM_GUD_NAMES_CHAN is set to a
value that is too small.
Macros are loaded during POWER ON/NCK RESET or selectively via PI service _N_F_COPY (activate macro via HMI
dialog). If alarm 15180 refers to a macro definition file, then MD18160 $MN_MM_NUM_USER_MACROS is set to a value
that is too small.
Cycle program definitions (PROC instruction) are reloaded at each POWER ON/NCK RESET. In case of failure check
parameter %3 to find out whether the name of the cycle program has caused the error - in this case, the value of MD18170
$MN_MM_NUM_MAX_FUNC_NAMES should be increased, or whether the name of a cycle call parameter has caused

14004 [Channel %1: ] Program %2 cannot be started because of a channel-specific start disable
Parameters: %1 = Channel number
%2 = (path with program name)
Explanation: The selected program %2 in channel%1 cannot be executed because the channel-specific start disable is set for this
channel.
Background: When ShopMill or ShopTurn programs are selected or changed, the HMI performs a consistency check of
the parameters that have been entered. During this time, the processing of the selected NC program is inhibited by the
HMI setting what is known as the "channel-specific start disable". If an NC start is now rejected because of a set channelspecific start disable, then alarm 14004 is output as a function of MD 11411 $MN_ENABLE_ALARM_MASK bit 15. The
alarm is also output in the event of a block search, but in this case it is not dependent on MD 11411
$MN_ENABLE_ALARM_MASK bit 15.

14005 [Channel %1: ] Block %2 program %3 program-specific start disable has been set
Parameters: %1 = Channel number
%2 = Block number, label
%3 = Program name
Explanation: Program %3 cannot be executed, because the program-specific start disable has been set for this file.
Background: When an editing operation for a ShopMill or ShopTurn program has been completed, the HMI performs a
consistency check of the parameters that have been entered. During this time, CNC program processing is inhibited by
setting what is known as the "program-specific start disable" by the HMI. If NC start is pressed during the test, the start is
not executed, and alarm 14005 is output as a function of MD 11411 $MN_ENABLE_ALARM_MASK bit 6.
Alarm 14005 is also output if the part program processing encounters a subroutine for which the file attribute "start disable"
is set.
After the test step has been completed, the program processing can continue by pressing NC start.

14007 [Channel %1: ] Block %2 Program %3 is being edited
Parameters: %1 = Channel number
%2 = Block number, label
%3 = Program name
Explanation: Program %3 cannot be executed because it has been disabled by another application, for example the HMI Editor.
Background: Program %3 is on an external data carrier (CF card, network drive, USB device), and should be executed
from there in EES mode (Execution from External Storage). But the program cannot be processed because it has been
opened for writing by another application, for example the HMI Editor, and the WRITE lock has been set for this file.

14008 [Channel %1: ] Block %2 WRITE command writes in the temporary memory area in /_N_EXT_DIR
Parameters: %1 = Channel number
%2 = Block number, label
Explanation: A workpiece is executed from an external data register (Execute from external drives function). The part programs are
temporarily stored in the NCK directory /_N_EXT_DIR. An attempt is now made to write in this temporary directory with a
WRITE command.
The alarm is intended to indicate that this data is not stored in the original directory on the external data carrier, and will
be lost at the next part program selection because the programs in the directory /_N_EXT_DIR will then be deleted.
Reaction: Alarm display.
Remedy: State a directory that remains permanently loaded in the NCK as the target for the WRITE command (e.g. MPF_DIR).

14011 [Channel %1: ] Block %2 program %3 not existing or will be edited
Parameters: %1 = Channel number
%2 = Block number, label
%3 = Program name
Explanation: A subroutine call was canceled because the called subroutine could not be opened.
The subroutine call can be executed via
- subroutine designator
- CALL / PCALL / MCALL command
- SETINT command
- M/T function replacement
- event-driven program calls (PROG_EVENT)
- selection of a PLC ASUB via PI "_N_ASUP__" and/or FB-4
- calling a PLC ASUB via interrupt interface (FC-9)
There are various reasons for the alarm:
- the subroutine is not in the parts program memory the subroutine
- the subroutine is not in the search path (selected directory, _N_SPF_DIR or cycle directories _N_CUS_DIR,
_N_CMA_DIR, _N_CST_DIR
- the subroutine has not been released or is being edited
- faulty absolute path name in subroutine call:
 Examples of complete path names: /_N_directoryName_DIR/_N_programmName_SPF or /_N_WKS_DIR/
_N_wpdName_WPD/_N_programmName_SPF. directoryName: MPF, SPF, CUS, CMA, CST (predefined directories).
wpdName: application-specific designator for workpiece directories (max. of 24 signs). programmName: Name of
subroutine (max. of 24 signs)
- A reload buffer for executing from external was called as subroutine.

14012 [Channel %1: ] Block %2 maximum subroutine level exceeded
Parameters: %1 = Channel number
%2 = Block number, label
Explanation: The maximum nesting depth of 16 program levels has been exceeded.
Subroutines can be called from the main program, and these in turn may have a nesting depth of 15.
For interrupt routines, two additional program levels can be used. This means that the total number of program levels is

14016 [Channel %1: ] Block %2 error when calling the subroutine via M/T function
Parameters: %1 = Channel number
%2 = Block number, label
Explanation: The following conflict was detected in a subprogram call per M or T function:
In the block referenced by parameter %2:
- An M or T function replacement has already been activated
- A modal subprogram call is active
- A subprogram return jump is programmed
- The end of part program is programmed
- An M98 subprogram call is active (only in external language mode)
- A T function replacement is programmed with D function programming in the same part program line with active TLC
(G43/G44) in the ISO2 system.
- A T function replacement is programmed, configured at the end of block, and a subprogram call, for example by a modal
cycle call.
Reaction: Correction block is reorganized.
Interface signals are set.
Alarm display.
Remedy: An M or T function replacement is only possible if a subprogram call or return jump has not already been performed as a
result of other program constructs. The part program must be corrected accordingly.
If a T function replacement is configured with execution at end of block and a subprogram call is programmed in the same
block, the T function replacement must be executed at start of block. This means that MD10719

Explanation: When the function DELOBJ is called, an attempt is made to reset a variable to its default value. The access authorization
is not sufficient for this purpose.
When this alarm occurs, no data are changed, not even that for which the access authorization would be sufficient.
This alarm can only occur when the current value of the system variable, to which the attempt to write led to the alarm, is
not equal to its initial setting value.

204 Diagnostics Manual, 01/2015, 6FC5398-6BP40-5BA2
Explanation: In circular interpolation, either the circle radii for the initial point and the end point are further apart, or the circle center
points are further apart, than specified in the machine data.
1. In circle radius programming the starting and end points are identical, thus the circle position is not determined by starting
and end points.
2. Radii: The NCK calculates from the present start point and the other programmed circle parameters the radii for the
start and the end point.
An alarm message is issued if the difference between the circle radii is either
- greater than the value in the MD21000 $MC_CIRCLE_ERROR_CONST (for small radii, if the programmed radius is
smaller than the quotient of the machine data MD21000 $MC_CIRCLE_ERROR_CONST divided by MD21010
$MC_CIRCLE_ERROR_FACTOR), or
- greater than the programmed radius multiplied by the MD21000 $MC_CIRCLE_ERROR_FACTOR (for large radii, if the
programmed radius is greater than the quotient of the machine data MD21010 $MC_CIRCLE_ERROR_CONST divided
by MD21010 $MC_CIRCLE_ERROR_FACTOR).
3. Center points: A new circle center is calculated using the circle radius at the starting position. It lies on the midperpendicular positioned on the connecting straight line from the starting point to the end point of the circle. The angle in
the radian measure between both straight lines from the starting point to the center calculated/programmed as such must
be lower than the root of 0.001 (corresponding to approx. 1.8 degrees).
Reaction: Correction block is reorganized.
Interface signals are set.
Alarm display.
Remedy: Please inform the authorized personnel/service department.
Check MD21000 $MC_CIRCLE_ERROR_CONST and MD21010 $MC_CIRCLE_ERROR_FACTOR. If the values are
within reasonable limits, the circle end point or the circle mid-point of the part program block must be programmed with
greater accuracy.

14045 [Channel %1: ] Block %2 error in tangential circle programming
Parameters: %1 = Channel number
%2 = Block number, label
Explanation: The alarm may have the following causes:
The tangent direction is not defined for tangent circle, e.g. because no other travel block has been programmed before
the current block. No circle can be formed from start and end point as well as tangent direction because - seen from the
start point - the end point is located in the opposite direction to that indicated by the tangent.
It is not possible to form a tangent circle since the tangent is located perpendicular to the active plane.
In the special case in which the tangent circle changes to a straight line, several complete circular revolutions were
programmed with TURN.

Parameters: %1 = Channel number
%2 = Block number, label
%3 = Axis name, spindle number
Explanation: One of the following programming errors has occurred:
1. The keyword WAITP(x) "Wait with the block change until the specified positioning axes has reached its end point", was
used for an axis that is not a positioning axis.
2. G74 "Reference point approach from the program" was programmed for a spindle. (Only axis addresses are permissible.)
3. The keyword POS/POSA was used for a spindle. (For spindle positioning, keywords SPOS and SPOSA should be
programmed.)
4. If the alarm occurs for the function "Thread tapping without compensating chuck " (G331) the following reasons are
conceivable:
- The master spindle is not in position-controlled operation.
- Incorrect master spindle
- Master spindle without encoder
5. An axis name that is no longer available has been programmed, e.g. when using axial variables as index. Or it was
programmed as index NO_AXIS.
6. If 14092 is output as note for alarm 20140 motion synchronized action: traverse the command axis, then the the following
causes are possible:
- The axis is presently being traversed by the NC program.
- An overlaid movement is active for the axis.
- The axis is active as slave axis of a coupling.
- An interpolation compensation such as a temperature compensation is active for the axis.
7. PRESETON/ PRESETONS were programmed for an unknown channel axis.

Parameters: %1 = Channel number
%2 = Block number, label
Explanation: During the program run, a variable value assignment or an arithmetic operation has caused data to be processed in such
a way that they have to be converted to another type. This would lead to the value range being exceeded.
Value ranges of the various variable types:
- REAL: Property: Fractional number with dec. pt., value range: +/-(2.2*10e-308 ... 1.8*10e308)
- INT: Property: Integers with signs, value range: -2147483648 ... +2147483647
- BOOL: Property: Truth value FALSE, TRUE, value range: 0 or 1
- CHAR: Property: 1 ASCII character, value range: 0-255
- STRING: Property: Character string (max. length depends on the variable), value range: 0 ... 255
- AXIS: Property: Axis addresses, value range: Channel identifier
- FRAME: Property: Geometric information, value range: ---
Overview of type conversions:
- from REAL to: REAL: yes, INT: yes*, BOOL: yes1), CHAR: yes*, STRING: -, AXIS: -, FRAME: -
- from INT to: REAL: yes, INT: yes, BOOL: yes1), CHAR: if value 0 ...255, STRING: -, AXIS: -, FRAME: -
- from BOOL to: REAL: yes, INT: yes, BOOL: yes, CHAR: yes, STRING: -, AXIS: -, FRAME: -
- from CHAR to: REAL: yes, INT: yes, BOOL: yes1), CHAR: yes, STRING: yes, AXIS: -, FRAME: -
- from STRING to: REAL: -, INT: -, BOOL: yes2), CHAR: only if 1 character, STRING: yes, AXIS: -, FRAME: -
- from AXIS to: REAL: -, INT: -, BOOL: -, CHAR: -, STRING: -, AXIS: yes, FRAME: -
- from FRAME to: REAL: -, INT: -, BOOL: -, CHAR: -, STRING: -, AXIS: -, FRAME: yes
1) Value <> 0 corresponds to TRUE, value ==0 corresponds to FALSE.
2) String length 0 => FALSE, otherwise TRUE.
3) If only 1 character.
It is not possible to convert from type AXIS and FRAME nor into type AXIS and FRAME.

14104 [Channel %1: ] Block %2 Active transformation allows neither vector programming nor interpolation
Parameters: %1 = Channel number
%2 = Block number, label
Explanation: The active orientation transformation does not allow either the programming of vectors for the tool orientation or the vector
interpolation (ORIVECT, ORICONxx, etc.) of the orientation. This is because the set kinematics of the transformation do
not have enough degrees of freedom to represent a general orientation of the tool, although the number of orientation
axes (rotary axes) would be sufficient for this purpose.
This occurs with the following kinematics:
The directions of rotation of 2 successive orientation axes are parallel (see MD24570 $MC_TRAFO5_AXIS1_x[0..2],
MD24572 $MC_TRAFO5_AXIS2_x[0..2] and MD24573 $MC_TRAFO5_AXIS3_x[0..2] (with 6-axis kinematics)).

Parameters: %1 = Channel number

%3 = Trafo index

Explanation: The position of the specified manual rotary axis is illegal; in other words, it violates the axis limits defined in
$NT_ROT_AX_MIN / $NT_ROT_AX_MAX.
This alarm may occur if a transformation is selected which uses this axis.
In the case of manual axes with Hirth tooth systems, the transformation may involve a position which, due to the rounding
of the value contained in $NT_ROT_AX_POS, actually relates to the adjacent grid position. The alarm may, therefore, also
occur if the content of $NT_ROT_AX_POS is within permissible limits but the modified position used internally violates

14112 [Channel %1: ] Block %2 programmed orientation path not possible, error no. %3
Parameters: %1 = Channel number
%2 = Block number, label
%3 = Error code
Explanation: In a 5-axis transformation, the two orientation axes place a coordinate system, comprising lengths and circles of latitude,
on a spherical surface. However, in some cases, the complete orientation sphere cannot be reached by the tool orientation.
This could be the case, for example, if the directions of rotation of the two orientation axes are not perpendicular to one
another. Then, there are usually are up to 2 pole caps on the orientation sphere, the orientation of which cannot be set
with the existing kinematics of the machine. This alarm is output if an orientation is programmed that lies outside the
possible range on the orientation sphere.
A non-settable orientation can only be specified by vector programming (direct programming of the vector components,
Euler or RPY angle, programming with virtual orientation axes), whereas a non-settable orientation cannot arise when the
rotary axis positions are programmed. Non-settable intermediate orientations can also only occur if vector interpolation is
active, whereas it can never occur with rotary axis interpolation. This alarm can therefore never occur if rotary axes are
programmed and the orientation is traversed by means of rotary axis interpolation.
The error number that is also output differentiates between specific situations:
1: The range of settable orientation is limited, but it is not restricted to one plane. This is, for example, the case with "normal"
nutator kinematics CA' with a rotary axis inclined at 45 degrees. The possible orientation range is then restricted to one
hemisphere.
2: The maximum settable orientation range is reduced to one plane. This means that the orientation can only be swiveled
in one plane. This situation is often caused by an incorrect, unwanted configuration of the orientation axes. This is, for
example, the case if the orientation axes are entered in the incorrect order. For example, if the axis sequence AC is specified
for tool kinematics instead of CA. If the initial setting of the tool is in the Z direction, the orientation can only be swiveled
in the YZ plane. This also occurs if the initial setting of the tool points in the X direction for CA tool kinematics.
Reaction: Correction block is reorganized.
Interface signals are set.
Alarm display.
Remedy: Change the part program and program an orientation that can be set with the kinematics of the machine. The alarm can
also be caused by an error in the configuration of the orientation axes of the transformation. In this case change the
configuration.

14152 [Channel %1: ] Block %2 tool carrier: invalid orientation. Error code: %3
Parameters: %1 = Channel number
%2 = Block number, label
%3 = Error code
Explanation: An attempt was made to define a tool orientation by means of the active frame which cannot be reached with the current
toolholder kinematics. This case can always occur when both rotary axes of the toolholder are not perpendicular to one
another or when the toolholder has fewer than two rotary axes;
or when rotary axis positions must be set that violate the corresponding axis limitations. Together with the alarm, an error
code is displayed that specifies the cause in detail:
 The error code has the following meaning:
 1: 1st rotary axis of the first solution violates the lower limit
 2: 1st rotary axis of the first solution violates the upper limit
 10: 2nd rotary axis of the first solution violates the lower limit
 20: 2nd rotary axis of the first solution violates the upper limit
 100: 1st rotary axis of the second solution violates the lower limit
 200: 1st rotary axis of the second solution violates the upper limit
 1000: 2nd rotary axis of the second solution violates the lower limit
 2000: 2nd rotary axis of the second solution violates the upper limit
 3: The required orientation cannot be set with the given axis configuration
Several of the error codes that indicate a violation of the axis limits can occur simultaneously
As, when an axis limit is violated, an attempt is made to reach a valid position within the permissible axis limits by adding
or substracting multiples of 360 degrees, it is - if this is not possible - not unequivocally defined whether the lower or upper
axis limit has been violated.

14156 [Channel %1: ] Toolholder selection error at reset
Parameters: %1 = Channel number
Explanation: The settings in MD20110 $MC_RESET_MODE_MASK require that an active orientable toolholder is maintained after the
reset. This is done by deselecting the old orientable toolholder and then reselecting it with data that may have been
modified. If an error occurs during the reselection, this alarm is issued (as a warning) and then an attempt is made to select
the orientable toolholder in the initial setting. If this second attempt is successful, the reset cycle is continued without any
further alarms.
Typically, the alarm only occurs when the old orientable toolholder has been selected with TCOFR, and its axis directions
have been changed in such a way before the reset that a setting suitable for the associated frame is no longer possible.
If there is another cause for the alarm, this results in an alarm also being issued when attempting to select in the initial
setting. This is then also displayed in plain text.

an orientable toolholder and a transformation defined by kinematic chains are activated on RESET and at program start.
This combination is not permissible. In this case, the content of machine data $MC_TOOL_CARRIER_RESET_VALUE is

Diagnostics Manual, 01/2015, 6FC5398-6BP40-5BA2 229
Explanation: An error occurred during the activation of the CUTMOD or CUTMODK function. The type of error is more closely defined
by the error code number:
For errors with error codes less than 100, MD20125 $MC_CUTMOD_ERR can be used to determine whether the error
condition is to lead to the issue of an alarm, and whether the alarm is only to be displayed or also trigger a program stop.
Errors with error codes greater than or equal to 100 always lead to a program stop.
Error code:
1 No valid cutting direction is defined for the active tool.
2 The cutting edge angles (clearance angle and holder angle) of the active tool are both zero.
3 The clearance angle of the active tool has an impermissible value (less than 0 degrees or greater than 180 degrees).
4 The holder angle of the active tool has an impermissible value (less than 0 degrees or greater than 90 degrees).
5 The tool tip angle of the active tool has an impermissible value (less than 0 degrees or greater than 90 degrees).
6 The cutting edge position - holder angle combination of the active tool is impermissible (with cutting edge positions 1
through 4, the holder angle must be less than or equal to 90 degrees, with cutting edge positions 5 through 8, it must
greater than or equal to 90 degrees).
7 The tool tip is not located in the machining plane, and the angle GAMMA between the tool tip and machining plane
exceeds the upper limit specified using setting data SD42998 $SC_CUTMOD_PLANE_TOL.
8 The cutting plate is not located in the machining plane. Angle ALPHA is greater than 1 degree. The angle ALPHA is
the angle of rotation around the coordinate axis, which is perpendicular to both the axis of rotation of the angle BETA and
the axis of rotation of the angle GAMMA (with G18 the X axis).
100 The rotation matrix to be used for calculating the modification of the cutting edge position does not describe a pure
rotation, that is it contains mirroring, scaling or shearing.
101 When CUTMODK is activated, there is no valid orientation transformation active. A 5 or 6-axis transformation defined
with kinematic chains must be active.
102 The language command "CUTMODK" was called with an invalid parameter. Only the parameters "NEW", "CLEAR",
"ON" and "OFF" are permitted.
Reaction: Correction block is reorganized.
Interface signals are set.

Remedy: Correct the tool data of the active tool, or modify the part program.
Alternatively, suppress the alarm for all errors with error numbers less than 100 with the aid of MD20125

- Parameterization via machine data has an error.
- Special requirement with respect to the machine axis has not been fulfilled (e.g. rotary axis is not a modulo axis) (->
modify machine data, restart).
TRACYL:
The programmed parameter is not allowed when transformation is selected.
TRAANG:
- The programmed parameter is not allowed when transformation is selected.
- Parameterization via machine data has an error.
- Parameter is faulty (e.g. TRAANG: unfavorable angle value (-> modify machine data, restart)

Parameters: %1 = Channel number
%2 = Block number, label
%3 = Identifier of the function which caused the error
NC alarms
Alarms
Diagnostics Manual, 01/2015, 6FC5398-6BP40-5BA2 253
Explanation: Initialization blocks are generated (or not) after control power-up, (program) RESET and (program) START, depending on
the settings in machine data MD20110 $MC_RESET_MODE_MASK and MD20112 $MC_START_MODE_MASK.
Errors can occur because of incorrect machine data settings. The errors are output with the same error messages as would
appear if the function had been incorrectly programmed in the part program.
This alarm is also generated in order to indicate that an error relates to the initialization sequence.
Parameter %3 specifies which function triggers the alarm:
Control power-up and (program) RESET:
Value:
0: Error during synchronization preprocessing/main run
1: Error on selection of tool length compensation
2: Error on selection of transformation
3: Error on selection of work offset
The macro definitions and cycle interfaces are also read in during the power-up procedure. If an error occurs here, this is
indicated by value = 4, or value = 5
6: Error creating 2 1/2 D protection areas during power up.
(Program) START:
Value
100: Error during synchronization preprocessing/main run
101: Error on selection of tool length compensation
102: Error on selection of transformation
103: Error on selection of synchronized spindle
104: Error on selection of work offset
105: Error after WRITE lock on the selected program
Particularly when tool management is active, it is possible that a tool on the spindle or the toolholder is disabled but still
needs to be activated.
These tools are automatically activated on RESET. On START, machine data MD22562
$MC_TOOL_CHANGE_ERROR_MODE can be used to specify whether an alarm is to be generated or an automatic
bypass strategy selected.
If the parameter contains 3 values from 200 to 203, this means that an insufficient number of NC blocks is available for
NC block preparation on certain commands (ASUB start, overstore selection, teach-in).
Remedy: Increase machine data MD28070 $MC_MM_NUM_BLOCKS_IN_PREP.
Reaction: Interpreter stop
Channel not ready.
NC Start disable in this channel.

14764 NCU-Link cannot transfer all non-cyclic link messages of type %2 immediately
Parameters: %1 = Type of non-cyclic link message (e.g. link variables, machine data, alarms)
Explanation: This alarm is used by cycle developers for diagnostic purposes.
The activation of these alarms can be configured with MD11416 $MN_LINK_DYNMSG_ALARM_MASK. The specified
type corresponds to the relevant bit in MD11416 (see bit description there).
A value assignment to a link variable (e.g. $a_dld[16]=19) is performed in the main run, and transferred via NCU link to all
NCUs in the link network. The bandwidth of this connection restricts the number of value assignments which can be
transferred in one interpolation cycle.
All value assignments are combined in the next main run block and performed immediately this block is executed. A main
run block is the block at which you would stop in single block mode SLB1.
Examples:
Blocks with a real traversing motion (G0 X100), Stopre, G4, WAITM, WAITE,...
The alarm occurs if the number of link variables set in any interpolation cycle exceeds the number that can be transferred.
The link variables are not transferred until one of the next interpolation cycles. The assignment is not lost!

14765 NCU link cannot transfer all link variables
Explanation: A value assignment to a link variable (e.g. $a_dld[16]=19) is performed in the main run and transferred via NCU link to all
NCUs in the link network. The bandwidth of this connection restricts the number of value assignments which can be
transferred in one interpolation cycle. Assignment operations which are not transferred are stored in a buffer memory. This
buffer is full!
All value assignments are combined in the next main run block and performed immediately this block is executed.
A main run block is the block at which you would stop in single block mode SLB1.
Examples: Blocks with a real traversing movement (G0 X100), Stopre, G4, WAITM, WAITE,...
Link variable scanning operations are not affected (e.g.: R100= $a_dld[16])
Reaction: NC Start disable in this channel.
Interface signals are set.
Alarm display.
NC Stop on alarm.
Remedy: Insert main run blocks which require a sufficient number of interpolation cycles for execution (e.g. G4 F10) between the
assignments. A block with an additional preprocessor stop does not improve the situation! See also
$A_LINK_TRANS_RATE, for a variable which you can test before an assignment.

assignments, machine data write operations, values for container switches and setting data write operations.
This type of data is buffered and is not lost. The buffer memory is now 70% full.
Reaction: Alarm display.

14769 [Channel %1: ] Block %2 Spindle %3 Implicit auxiliary function %4 Buffer full
Parameters: %1 = Channel number
%2 = Block number, label
%3 = Spindle number
%4 = Auxiliary function number
Explanation: A maximum of 5 auxiliary functions of type "M" may be entered in an NC block. The upper limit is the total of programmed
and implicitely generated M auxiliary functions. Implicit auxiliary functions M19 and M70 are generated, if in MD35035
$MA_SPIND_FUNCTION_MASK, bit 19 has been set for M19 and/or bit 20 for M70. M19 is generated with SPOS and
SPOSA depending on the configuration. The same applies to M70 and transition into axis operation. The address extension
corresponds to the spindle number like it is output to the PLC.
Reaction: Correction block is reorganized.
Interface signals are set.
Alarm display.
Remedy: - Distribute the M auxiliary functions and spindle functions that implicitely generate M19 and M70 to several blocks.
- Deactivate any implicit auxiliary functions that are not required in MD35035 $MA_SPIND_FUNCTION_MASK, bit 19 and/
or bit 20.

14770 [Channel %1: ] Block %2 auxiliary function programmed incorrectly
Parameters: %1 = Channel number
%2 = Block number, label
Explanation: The permissible number of programmed auxiliary functions per NC block has been exceeded or more than one auxiliary
function of the same auxiliary function group has been programmed (M and S function).
In the user-defined auxiliary functions, the maximum number of auxiliary functions per group in the NCK system settings
has been defined for all auxiliary functions by means of the MD11100 $MN_AUXFU_MAXNUM_GROUP_ASSIGN (default:
1)
For each user-defined auxiliary function to be assigned to a group, the assignment is effected through 4 channel-specific
machine data.
Return jump from asynchronous subprogram with M02/M17/M30, whereby the M code is not alone in the block. This is
impermissible if the asynchronous subprogram interrupts a block with WAITE, WAITM or WAITMC. Remedy: Program
M02/M17/M30 alone in the block or replace via RET.
22010 AUXFU_ASSIGN_TYPE: type of auxiliary function, e.g. M

Explanation: With a CHANDATA instruction, the data input for a channel is selected that has not been activated.
Reaction: NC Start disable in this channel.
Interface signals are set.
Alarm display.
Remedy: This is an informational alarm referring to the fact that the file loaded into the NCK contains data of an inactive channel.
The number of the inactive channel is specified. Subsequently, the data of this channel are not available in the NCK.
The alarm may have two causes:
(1) The channel is supposed to be activated by a following NCK RESET/POWER ON, i.e. the file must subsequently be
reloaded.If the alarm occurs again, the reason is: (2) the specified channel is actually not supposed to be activated,
however, the file contains the relevant data.
For the 2nd reason, please check whether the system has correctly not activated the channel mentioned.
If the channel has been activated, operation may be continued after another NCK RESET/POWER ON without further
measures, i.e. reloading the file is not required. If the channel has not been activated, make sure that the channel inactivated
by mistake is re-activated.
If the settings of the channel activation are part of the file to be loaded (e.g. archive file), the file must either be modified
with the relevant program or the file has to be created once more in the same system with the correct channel number.

Explanation: In order to synchronize the preprocessing run and the main run with REORG, the control accesses modification data which
are maintained in a logfile. The alarm indicates that no more capacity is available in the logfile for the specified block in
the channel.
The alarm message means that the logfile has been deleted in order to obtain additional memory for program
reorganization. Consequently, it is no longer possible to REORG the preprocessing memory up to the next coincidence
point.
Reaction: Alarm display.

15120 If a power failure occurs now, the last data changed will be lost; index/buffer size = %1
Parameters: %1 = Index/buffer size
Explanation: Notification alarm. The alarm has no negative impact on the current machining.
One of the system-internal data buffers, in which the last changed, buffered data are stored,
has overflowed because the current data change rate is too high.
The alarm warns that a spontaneous power failure in this situation
(mains fault, disconnect the system from the power supply) would
cause a loss of the immediately previously changed buffered data
(tool data, parts programs, R variables, GUDs,...)
If the system is operated in an environment in which a power failure cannot occur, then the output of
this alarm can be prevented via machine data MD18232 $MN_MM_ACTFILESYS_LOG_FILE_MEM[ index ] = 0.
For information, parameter %1
specifies the index of the machine data,
 and the buffer size set there.
Reaction: Alarm display.
Remedy: If the alarm is present only sporadically, it can simply be regarded as a notification.
The regular control behavior is not affected.
If one does not want to or cannot eliminate the cause, then the alarm can be suppressed by setting
MD11415 $MN_SUPPRESS_ALARM_MASK_2; Bit3=1 ('H8').
If the alarm is permanently present, please inform the authorized personnel/service department.

15122 Power ON after power failure: %1 data were restored, of which %2 machine data, %3 errors.
Parameters: %1 = Number of data
%2 = Number of machine data
%3 = Number of errors occurred
Explanation: Notification alarm. The alarm has no negative effect as long as %3 the number of errors occurred is zero.
%1 indicates the number of elementary and complex data restoring steps which were taken after a power OFF during
power ON orduring a power failure to restore the persistent NCK data.
%2 indicates the number of restored machine data. If the value is larger than zero, another warm restart (NCK reset) may
be necessary to make the - possibly configuring - machine data changes prior to the power failure effective.
%3 indicates the number of errors occurred during data restoring.
Reaction: Alarm display.
Remedy: As long as %3 number of errors occurred is zero, the alarm is only informative.
As long as %3 number of errors occurred is larger than zero, the alarm indicates a software error.
Further machining with the data is not recommended.
Please load a suitable archive file before continuing machining to avoid subsequent problems.

15150 [Channel %1: ] Block %2 reload from external canceled
Parameters: %1 = Channel number
%2 = Block number, label
Explanation: Execution from external was canceled because the reload buffer does not have enough machine function blocks (traversing
blocks, auxiliary function, dwell time etc.). Background: When already executed machine function blocks are released,
memory becomes available in the reload buffer. If machine function blocks are no longer released, nothing can be reloaded
- this results in a deadlock situation.
Example: Definition of extremely long curve tables via execution from external.

Identifiier (parameter 3) is bit-coded and displays some possible causes for the alarm:
0x01 Axis is in another channel
0x02 Axis is in spindle mode (e.g. SPOS)
0x04 Axis is PLC axis
0x08 Axis is oscillating axis
0x10 Axis is neutral axis
0x20 Axis is coupled slave axis
0x40 Axis is in static synchronized action

16020 [Channel %1: ] Repositioning in block %2 is not possible
Parameters: %1 = Channel number
%2 = Block number, label
Explanation: Programming or operator action incorrect:
Repositioning via REPOS command is only possible in an asynchronous subprogram (interrupt routine).
If the REPOS command was programmed, e.g. in the main program or in a cycle, part program execution is canceled with
alarm 16020.
In addition, the alarm is output in the following situations:
- Access to $AC_RETPOINT (repositioning point) outside an ASUB (e.g. in the main program)
- An axis to be repositioned was a oscillating axis with sychronous infeed (OSCILL) in the interrupted block and is now in
a state that does not allow it to be traversed as a oscillating axis. Remedy: Change the axis to "neutral axis" state before
repositioning with WAITP.
- An axis to be repositioned was an infeed axis for a oscillating axis in the interrupted block; now it can no longer be
traversed as one. Remedy: Change the axis back to "POS axis" state before repositioning.

%2 = Block number, label
%3 = Axis name, spindle number
Explanation: In the rotated coordinate system, traversing of a geometry axis as positioning axis (i.e. along its axis vector in the rotated
coordinate system) would mean traversing of several machine axes. This is in conflict with the positioning axis concept,
however, in which one axis interpolator runs in addition to the path interpolator!
Reaction: Correction block is reorganized.
Interface signals are set.
Alarm display.
Remedy: Traverse geometry axes as positioning axes only with rotation deactivated.

16930 [Channel %1: ] Preceding block and current block %2 must be separated through an executable
block
Parameters: %1 = Channel number
%2 = Block number
Explanation: The language functions WAITMC, SETM, CLEARM and MSG must be programmed in separate NC blocks. To avoid
velocity drops, these blocks are attached to the next NC block internally in the NCK (for WAITMC to the previous NC block).
For this reason, there must always be an executable block (not a calculation block) between the NC blocks. An executable
NC block always includes e.g. travel movements, a help function, STOPRE, dwell time etc.
Note: This does not apply to the programming of MSG with the additional parameter "1", in this case a separate block is
generated, which interrupts the continuous-path mode.
Reaction: Correction block is reorganized.

Explanation: Reorg events are, e.g. cancelation subprogram, delete distance to go and interrupts, axis exchange, termination of followup mode. Two Reorg events overlap in this situation. The 2nd Reorg event coincides with the 1st block generated by the
previous event. (e.g. an axis exchange is induced twice in rapid succession). Axis exchange leads to Reorg in the channels
in which an axis is removed without preparation. This block must be stopped in the above sequence in order to prevent
the interpolator buffer from overflowing. This can be achieved by pressing the Stop or StopAll key, configuring an alarm
with INTERPRETERSTOP or by decode single block.

16941 [Channel %1: ] Action %2<ALNX> rejected because no program event has been executed yet
Parameters: %1 = Channel number
%2 = Action number/action name
Explanation: The setting of the MD20108 $MC_PROG_EVENT_MASK forces an asynchronous subprogram to be triggered
automatically on RESET or PowerOn. The implicitly triggered asynchronous subprograms are normally called "Eventtriggered program call" or "Program event".
In the alarm situation, this asynchronous subprogram could not yet be activated; that is why the action (normally start of
part program) must be rejected.
Reasons for the fact that the asynchronous subprogram could not be triggered:
1. The asynchronous subprogram does not exist (/_N_CMA_DIR/_N_PROG_EVENT_SPF)
2. The asynchronous subprogram is allowed to start in the referenced state only (see MD11602
$MN_ASUP_START_MASK)
3. READY is missing (because of alarm)
Reaction: Alarm display.

16942 [Channel %1: ] Start program command action %2<ALNX> not possible
Parameters: %1 = Channel number
%2 = Action number/action name
Explanation: Currently, the alarm occurs only in combination with the SERUPRO action. SERUPRO stands for search via program test.
SERUPRO is currently searching the search target and has therefore switched this channel to the program test mode.
With the START program command in channel 1, another channel 2 would actually be started, which means that axes
would really be started during the search action.
If this alarm is switched off (see help), the user can make use of the above behavior by initially selecting via PLC the
program test mode in channel 2, leaving channel 2 executing until its natural end, stopping channel 2 in order to deselect
program test again.
Reaction: NC Start disable in this channel.
Interface signals are set.

NC Stop on alarm.
Remedy: Alarm can be switched off with MD10708 $MN_SERUPRO_MASK bit 1.
Programm
continuation:
Clear alarm with the RESET key. Restart part program
16943 [Channel %1: ] Action %2<ALNX> not possible due to ASUB
Parameters: %1 = Channel number
%2 = Action number/action name
Explanation: The action in the 2nd parameter was rejected, since an asynchronous subprogram is currently active.
Currently, only the integrated search run is rejected with this alarm. The integrated search run is activated, if search run
is triggered in the Stop program state. In other words: Parts of a program have already been executed and a following
program part is "skipped" with search run in order to continue the program afterwards.
The event is not possible if the program is stopped within an asynchronous subprogram or if an asynchronous subprogram
had been selected before the event. An asynchronous subprogram is selected, when the triggering asynchronous
subprogram event arrives, but the asynchronous subprogram cannot be started (e.g. the asynchronous start program is
not started because of a read-in disable or because the Stop key is active).
In this case, it is irrelevant whether a user ASUB or a system ASUB has been triggered. User ASUBs are activated via
FC-9 or via the fast inputs.
The following events lead to system ASUBS:
- Mode change
- Overstore on
- Canceling subprogram level
- Switching on of single block, type 2
- Setting machine data effective
- Setting user data effective
- Change skip levels
- Dry run on/off

16944 [Channel %1: ] Action %2<ALNX> not possible due to active search blocks
Parameters: %1 = Channel number
%2 = Action number/action name
Explanation: The NCK is currently processing either the action blocks of the search run or the approach motion after the search run. In
this situation, the action (2nd parameter of the alarm) must be rejected. Currently, only the integrated search run is rejected
with this alarm. The integrated search run is activated, if search run is triggered in the Stop program state. In other words:
Parts of a program have already been executed and a following program part is "skipped" with search run in order to
continue the program afterwards.
Reaction: Alarm display.
Remedy: Repeat the action after the approach motion of the search run.
Programm
continuation:
Clear alarm with the Delete key or NC START.
16945 [Channel %1: ] Action %2<ALNX> delayed up to the block end
Parameters: %1 = Channel number
%2 = Action number/action name
Explanation: The currently executing action (e.g. dry run on/off, change skip levels, etc.) should be active immediately, but it can become
active not earlier than at the end of the block, since a thread is currently being machined. The action is activated with a
slight delay.
Example: Dry run is started in the middle of the thread, then traversing at high speed does not start before the next block.
Reaction: Alarm display.
Remedy: Alarm can be switched off via MD11410 $MN_SUPPRESS_ALARM_MASK bit17==1.
Programm
continuation:
Clear alarm with the Delete key or NC START.
16946 [Channel %1: ] Start via START is not allowed
Parameters: %1 = Channel ID
Explanation: This alarm is active with "Group Serupro" only. "Group Serupro" is activated by means of MD10708
$MN_SERUPRO_MASK, Bit 2 and enables the retrace support of entire channel groups during block search.
The MD22622 $MC_DISABLE_PLC_START specifies which channel is generally started from the PLC and which channel
is only allowed to be started from another channel via the START part program command.
This alarm occurs if the channel was started via the START part programm command and MD22622
$MC_DISABLE_PLC_START==FALSE was set.
Reaction: Alarm display.
Remedy: Modify MD22622 $MC_DISABLE_PLC_START of switch off "Group Serupro" (see MD10708 $MN_SERUPRO_MASK).
Programm

16947 [Channel %1: ] Start via PLC is not allowed
Parameters: %1 = Channel ID
Explanation: This alarm is active with "Group Serupro" only. "Group Serupro" is activated by means of MD10708
$MN_SERUPRO_MASK, Bit 2 and enables the retrace support of entire channel groups during block search.
The machine data MD22622 $MC_DISABLE_PLC_START specifies which channel is generally started from the PLC and
which channel is only allowed to be started from another channel via the START part program command.
This alarm occurs if the channel was started via the PLC and MD22622 $MC_DISABLE_PLC_START==TRUE was set.

16948 [Channel %1: ] dependent channel %2 still active
Parameters: %1 = Channel ID
%2 = Channel ID
Explanation: This alarm is active with "Group Serupro" only. "Group Serupro" is activated by means of MD10708
$MN_SERUPRO_MODE, bit 2 and enables the retrace support of entire channel groups during block search.
A _dependent channel_ is a channel that had indirectly been started by the currently active channel. The currently active
channel was started via PLC.
This channel m_u_s_t be terminated (i.e. reached M30) before the current channel is terminated.
This alarm occurs if the currently active channel is terminated before the dependent channel.
Reaction: Alarm display.

16949 Correspondence between marker of channel %1 and channel %2 is invalid.
Parameters: %1 = Channel ID
%2 = Channel ID
Explanation: This channel defines a WAIT marker with other channels, which on their part have no correspondence with this wait marker.
This channel's WAIT marker has no explicit counterpart in the other channel; i.e. the channels do not mutually wait.
============================================================
Example
Ch 3 Ch 5 Ch 7
WAITM(99,3,5) WAITM(99,3,5) WAITM(99,5,7)
The wait markers in channels 3 and 5 mutually wait for each other and channel 7 only waits for channel 5. Therefore,
channel 7 may continue when 5 and 7 have reached the wait marker, but channel 3 is still far in front of the wait marker.
When it continues, channel 7 deletes its wait marker. When wait marker 99 is reached again, you can no longer determine
the behavior precisely.
============================================================
Reaction: Alarm display.
Remedy: In each wait marker, list all channels with which you want to synchronize, or suppress the alarm with MD11410
$MN_SUPPRESS_ALARM_MASK, bit 23.
============================================================
Sample solution A:
Ch 3 Ch 5 Ch 7

Parameters: %1 = Channel number
NC alarms
Alarms
Diagnostics Manual, 01/2015, 6FC5398-6BP40-5BA2 335
Explanation: Informational alarm.
The search run was not performed on the interruption block, instead, it touches down shortly before that. This so-called
"hold block" is generated by the part program command IPTRLOCK, or implicitly defined by MD22680
$MC_AUTO_IPTR_LOCK. This is to prevent you from performing a search run in critical program areas (e.g. gear hobbing).
The alarm also displays that, instead of searching for the block that actually was interrupted before, another block is being
searched for. This behavior is desired and the alarm serves only informational purposes.
Reaction: Alarm display.
Remedy: MD11410 $MN_SUPPRESS_ALARM_MASK, MD22680 $MC_AUTO_IPTR_LOCK and language command IPTRLOCK
Programm
continuation:
Clear alarm with the Delete key or NC START.
16951 [Channel %1: ] Search run in a protected program section.
Parameters: %1 = Channel number
Explanation: A part programmer can define protected part program sections with the language commands IPTRLOCK and
IPTRUNLOCK. Every search run in these program sections will then be acknowledged with alarm 16951. In other words:
When the alarm appears, the user has started a search run (Serupro type) and the search target lies in a protected area.
A protected area can also be defined implicitly with the MD22680 $MC_AUTO_IPTR_LOCK.
Note:
The alarm can only be generated if the simulation has been completed during the search run. The alarm cannot be output
immediately at the start of the search run.
Reaction: NC Start disable in this channel.

Parameters: %1 = Channel ID
NC alarms
Alarms
Diagnostics Manual, 01/2015, 6FC5398-6BP40-5BA2 337
Explanation: The program area (Stop-Delay area), which is bracketed by DELAYFSTON and DELAYFSTOF, could not be activated.
Every stop therefore becomes effective immediately and is not delayed!
This occurs every time, when braking into a stop Stop-Delay area, i.e. a braking process starts before the Stop-Delay area
and ends not earlier than in the Stop-Delay area.
If the Stop-Delay area is entered with override 0, the Stop-Delay area can also not be activated
Example: a G4 before the Stop-Delay area allows the user to reduce the override to 0. The next block in the Stop-Delay
area then starts with override 0 and the alarm situation described occurs.
MD11411 $MN_ENABLE_ALARM_MASK, bit 7 switches on this alarm.

17001 [Channel %1: ] Block %2 no memory left for tool/magazine data
Parameters: %1 = Channel number
%2 = Block number, label
Explanation: The number of the following tool/magazine data variables in the NC is specified using machine data:
- Number of tools + number of grinding data blocks: MD18082 $MN_MM_NUM_TOOL
- Number of cutting edges: MD18100 $MN_MM_NUM_CUTTING_EDGES_IN_TOA
Tools, grinding data blocks, cutting edges can be used independently of the tool management.
The memory for the following data is available only if the corresponding bit has been set in MD18080
$MN_MM_TOOL_MANAGEMENT_MASK.
- Number of monitoring data blocks: MD18100 $MN_MM_NUM_CUTTING_EDGES_IN_TOA
- Number of magazines: MD18084 $MN_MM_NUM_MAGAZINE
- Number of magazine locations: MD18086 $MN_MM_NUM_MAGAZINE_LOCATION
The following variable is determined by the software configuration: Number of magazine spacing data blocks: P2 permits
32 such spacing data blocks.
Definition:
- 'Grinding data blocks': Grinding data can be defined for a tool of type 400 to 499. A data block of this type occupies as
much additional memory as that provided for a cutting edge.
- 'Monitoring data blocks': Each cutting edge of a tool can be supplemented with monitoring data.
- If the alarm occurs while writing one of the parameters $TC_MDP1/$TC_MDP2/$TC_MLSR,
check whether machine data MD18077 $MN_MM_NUM_DIST_REL_PER_MAGLOC /
MD18076$MN_MM_NUM_LOCS_WITH_DISTANCE has been set correctly.
MD18077 $MN_MM_NUM_DIST_REL_PER_MAGLOC defines the number of different Index1 statements that may be
made for an Index2 value.
MD18076 $MN_MM_NUM_LOCS_WITH_DISTANCE defines the number of different buffer locations that may be named
in Index2.
If a multitool is to be generated or its locations, the alarm indicates that either more multitools need to be generated than
are permitted by the setting of MD18083 $MN_MM_NUM_MULTITOOL or, if the alarm occurs when the multitool locations
are being generated, that more multitool locations need to be generated than is permitted by the setting of MD18085
$MN_MM_NUM_MULTITOOL_LOCATIONS.

Diagnostics Manual, 01/2015, 6FC5398-6BP40-5BA2 341
Explanation: General:
Read or write access has been programmed to an array variable with an illegal 1st array index. The valid array indices
must lie within the defined array size and the absolute limits (0 - 32,766).
PROFIBUS I/O:
An illegal slot / I/O area index was used while reading/writing data.
 Cause:
 1.: Slot / I/O area index >= max. number of available slot / I/O areas.
 2.: Slot / I/O area index references a slot / I/O area that has not been configured.
 3.: Slot / I/O area index references a slot / I/O area that has not been released for system variables.
The following applies specifically: If the alarm occurs while writing one of the parameters
$TC_MDP1/$TC_MDP2/$TC_MLSR,
check whether MD18077 $MN_MM_NUM_DIST_REL_PER_MAGLOC has been set correctly.
MD18077 $MN_MM_NUM_DIST_REL_PER_MAGLOC defines the number of different Index1 statements that may be
made for an Index2 value.
If an MT number is programmed, the value may collide with a previously defined T number or a previously defined magazine
number.

17050 [Channel %1: ] Block %2 illegal value
Parameters: %1 = Channel number
%2 = Block number, label
Explanation: A value has been programmed that exceeds the value range or a limit value of a variable or a machine data item.
For example: In a string variable (e.g. GUD or LUD), a string needs to be written that exceeds the agreed string length in
the variable definition.
 - If an illegal value is to be written to a tool or magazine management variable (e.g. illegal cutting edge number in
$TC_DPCE[x,y] or illegal magazine location number in $TC_MDP2[x,y])
 - The value of MTL is incorrect. MTL must be programmed with a multitool location number of a multitool that is
programmed in the command T=magazine location number in the same NC block.
 - An illegal value is to be written in $P_USEKT or $A_DPB_OUT[x,y]
 - An illegal value is to be written in a machine data (e.g. MD10010 $MN_ASSIGN_CHAN_TO_MODE_GROUP[0] = 0)
 - On accessing an individual frame element, a frame component other than TRANS, ROT, SCALE or MIRROR was
addressed or the CSCALE function was assigned a negative scale factor.

Explanation: In the displayed block, a tool is accessed that is not defined and is therefore not available. The tool has been named by
its T number, its name or its name and duplo number.
If the function T=magazine location is activated and programmed, the programmed T number indicates the magazine
location number. The alarm can then indicate that the programmed magazine location number is illegal.

Remedy: If the program pointer is at an NC block which contains the specified T identifier: If the program is incorrect, remedy the
error with a correction block and continue the program. If the data block is missing, create one. You can do this by
downloading a data block with all the defined D numbers onto the NCK (via MMC with overstore) and continue the program.
If the program pointer is at an NC block which does not contain the specified T identifier: The error occurred at an earlier
point in the program where the T command appeared, but the alarm was not output until the change command was detected.
If the program is incorrect - T5 programmed instead of T55 - the current block can be corrected with a correction block;
i.e. if only M06 is entered, you can correct the block with T55 M06. The incorrect T5 line remains in the program until it is
terminated by a RESET or end of program.
In complex program structures with indirect programming, it may not be possible to correct the program. In this case, you
can only intervene locally with an overstore block - with T55 in the example. If the data block is missing, create one. You
can do this by downloading the data block of the tool with all the defined D numbers onto the NCK (via MMC with overstore),
program the T command with overstore, and continue the program.

Parameters: %1 = Channel number
%2 = Axis name, spindle number
Explanation: At the beginning of phase 2 of reference point approach, the signal from the reduction cam is no longer available.
Phase 2 of reference point approach begins when the axis remains stationary after deceleration to the reduction cam. The
axis then starts in the opposite direction in order to select the next zero marker of the measuring system on leaving the
reduction cam or approaching it again (negative/positive edge).

Remedy: Please inform the authorized personnel/service department. Check whether the deceleration path after the approach
velocity is greater than the distance to the reference point cam - in which case the axis cannot stop until it is beyond the
cam. Use a longer cam or reduce the approach velocity in MD34020 $MA_REFP_VELO_SEARCH_CAM.
When the axis has stopped at the cam, it must be checked whether the signal DB31, ... DBX12.7 (Deceleration reference
point approach) is still available at the interface to the NCK.

Phase 2 of the reference point approach ends when the zero mark of the encoder has been detected after the rising/falling
edge of the NC/PLC interface signal DB31, ... DBX12.7 (Deceleration reference point approach) has given the trigger start.
The maximum distance between the trigger start and the zero mark that follows is defined in the MD34060

20052 [Channel %1: ] Axis %2 already active
Parameters: %1 = Channel number
%2 = Axis name, spindle number
Explanation: The axis is to traverse as a machine axis in JOG mode using the direction keys on the machine control panel. However,
this is not possible because:
1. It is already traversing as a geometry axis (through the channel-specific interface DB21-30 DBX12.6 / 12.7 (Traversing
keys -/+) or DB21-30 DBX16.6 / 16.7 (Traversing keys -/+) or DB21-30 DBX20.6 / 20.7 (Traversing keys -/+)) or
2. It is already traversing as a machine axis (through the axis-specific interface DB31, ... DBX4.7 / 4.6 (Traversing keys
plus/minus)) or
3. A frame is valid for a rotated coordinate system, and another geometry axis involved in this is already traversing in JOG
mode by means of the direction keys.
4. As part of a retraction motion (submode JOG-Retract) it cannot be traversed as a machine axis.
Reaction: Alarm display.

20054 [Channel %1: ] Axis %2 wrong index for indexing axis in JOG mode
Parameters: %1 = Channel number
%2 = Axis name, spindle number
Explanation: 1. The displayed indexing axis is to be traversed incrementally in JOG mode (by 1 indexing position). However, no further
indexing position is available in the selected direction.
2. The axis is stationary at the last indexing position. In incremental traversing the working area limitation or the software
limit switch is reached without an indexing position being located in front of it at which a stop could be made.
Reaction: Alarm display.
Remedy: Please inform the authorized personnel/service department. Correct (add to) the list of indexing positions by means of the

Remedy: Please inform the authorized personnel/service department.
If the revolutional feed is also to be active in JOG mode, then a master spindle must be declared via the channel-specific
MD20090 $MC_SPIND_DEF_MASTER_SPIND. In this case you have to open a screen in the PARAMETER operating
area with the softkeys "SETTINGDATA" and "JOG DATA" and preselect the G function G95 there. The JOG feedrate can
then be entered in [mm/rev]. (If 0 mm/rev is set as JOG feed, the control takes the value assigned in the axis-specific MD
32050 $MA_JOG_REV_VELO or in the case of rapid traverse overlay MD32040 $MA_JOG_REV_VELO_RAPID).

 4: Drive signal DB31, ... DBX93.5 (Drive ready) is not set
 5: Drive signal DB31, ... DBX92.4 (Autonomous drive) does not follow the NC setpoints
One of the motion-enabling signals (e.g. "Servo enable", "Pulse enable", parking/encoder selection (only for axes) or drivespecific enables has been reset for the displayed axis. The alarm can be reported with positioning axes, spindles and for
axes from the geometry grouping.
The axes entered in the channel-specific MD array MD20050 $MC_AXCONF_GEOAX_ASSIGN_TAB are regarded as
axes belonging to the geometry grouping. Servo enable must exist for all available geometry axes, regardless of whether
or not they are currently in motion.

21619 [Channel %1: ] Block %2 transformation active: motion not possible
Parameters: %1 = Channel number
%2 = Block number, label
Explanation: The machine kinematics does not allow the specified motion. Transformation-dependent error causes can be in:
TRANSMIT: A (circular) area exists around the pole, where positioning is not possible. The area is caused by the fact that
the tool reference point cannot be traversed as far as into the pole. The area is defined by:
- the machine data (MD249.. $MC_TRANSMIT_BASE_TOOL_...)
- the active tool length compensation (see $TC_DP..).
Whether the tool length compensation is included in the calculation depends on the working plane selected (see G17,..).
The machine stops at the edge of the area where positioning is not possible.
Reaction: Local alarm reaction.

Explanation: Measurement level 2 (MEASA, MEAWA, MEAC).
There is an error in the programmed measurement task.
Possible causes:
- Invalid measurement mode
- Invalid probe
- Invalid encoder
- Invalid number of measurement signal edges
- Identical measurement signal edges are only programmable in mode 2
- Invalid FIFO number
- Mismatch between the number of FIFOs programmed and the number of probes used in the measurement task.

Explanation: The measurement block has ended (the programmed end position of the axis has been reached) but the activated touch
probe has not yet responded.
Measurement level 2 (MEAWA, MEASA, MEAC)
Measured values cannot be converted to the workpiece coordinate system. The measured values of the GEO axes
programmed in the measurement task are only available in the machine coordinate system.
Causes:
Not all GEO axes were programmed in the measurement task. At least one measured value is therefore missing for
conversion back into the workpiece coordinate system.
Further causes:
The measurement tasks programmed for all GEO axes are not identical.
When making measurements without handshake, two probes must be available in drive parameters p0680 index 0 and 1.
Reaction: Alarm display.
Remedy: Check the traversing movement in the measurement block.
- Is it necessary in all cases for the activated probe to have switched up to the specified axis position?
- Are the probe, cable, cable distributor, terminal connections in good order?
- Is the probe correctly wired and configured on the hardware side (e.g. drive parameters p0488 and p0489)?
Either program all GEO axes explicitly or program the traversing movement with the POS[axis] command.

Explanation: The width of the cam signal undershoots the time t=50µs and as a result can no longer be output.
This is because:
 The cam signal width of t=50µs must not be undershot.
 A configured cam width and reliable time results in
 a limit velocity for the cam (v=s/t). If the limit velocity is exceeded,

variably
Parameters: %1 = Channel number
%2 = Block number, label
%3 = Leading spindle number
%4 = Number of following spindle
Explanation: If the spindles / axes differ strongly in their dynamic behavior during coupling, synchronism cannot be achieved. The
dynamics are dependent on many settings: default feedforward control, parameter block data, first of all the servo gain
factor, symmetrizing time, etc., feedforward control mode and feedforward setting parameter, FIPO mode, jerk filter and
dynamic filter settings, DSC on/off. Among these are the following machine data: MD32620 $MA_FFW_MODE, MD32610
$MA_VELO_FFW_WEIGHT, MD33000 $MA_FIPO_TYPE, VEL_FFW_TIME, MD32810

%4 = Reason
Explanation: The determination of the offset value ($AA_COUP_CORR[Sn]) intended by the NC/PLC signal DB31, ... DBX31.6 (correct
synchronism) cannot be executed. The offset value cannot be calculated properly. The reasons for this may be:
- Reason 1: The following axis is not configured as a spindle.
- Reason 2: The coupling has more than one active leading axis.
- Reason 3: The leading axis is not configured as a spindle.
- Reason 4: The coupling factor (the quotient from CPLNUM and CPLDEN) is neither 1 nor -1.
- Reason 5: CPLSETVAL = "cmdvel".
- Reason 6: An independent motion component (NC/PLC interface signal DB31, ... DBX98.4(overlaid motion) = 1) of the
following spindle is active.
- Reason 7: There is no following spindle synchronism on the setpoint side.
- Reason 8: The synchronism on the setpoint side has decreased again.
- Reason 9: The following or leading spindle is a link axis (NCU_LINK).
Reaction: Alarm display.
Remedy: The following remedies are available for the indicated reasons:
- Reasons 1 to 5: The coupling has to be reconfigured / reprogrammed.
- Reasons 6 and 7: Wait until NC/PLC interface signals DB31, ... DBX99.4 (Synchronization running) = 0 and DB31, ...
DBX98.4 (Overlaid motion) = 0 before setting NC/PLC DB31, ... DBX31.6 (Correct synchronism) .

Explanation: The specified tool group does not contain a tool which is ready for use and could be used for tool change. It is possible
that all of the tools in question have been set to the 'Disabled' state by the tool monitoring function. The alarm can occur
for example in conjunction with the alarm 14710 (error on INIT block generation). In this specific situation, NCK attempts
to replace the disabled tool located on the spindle with an available replacement tool (which does not exist in this error
condition).
The user must resolve this conflict, for example, by removing the tool located on the spindle from the spindle by issuing a
movement command (e.g. through MMC operation).

22070 [TO unit %1: ] Please change tool %2 into magazine. Repeat data backup
Parameters: %1 = TO unit
%2 = T number of tool
Explanation: The alarm can only occur when the tool management function is active in the NCK. (TOOLMAN = tool management) A
data backup of the tool/magazine data has been started. During the backup, the system detected that tools are still located
in the buffer magazine (= spindle, gripper, ...). During the backup, these tools will lose the information which defines the
magazine and location to which they are allocated.
It is therefore practical -assuming that the data are to be stored exactly as before - to ensure that all tools have been
deposited in the magazine before the data backup!!
If this is not the case, some magazine locations will have the 'reserved' status when the data are loaded again. This
'reserved' status must then be reset manually.
For tools with fixed location coding, the loss of the information allocating their location in the magazine has the same effect
as a general empty location search when they are returned to the magazine.
Reaction: Interface signals are set.
Alarm display.
Remedy: Ensure that no tools are located in the buffer magazine before the data backup. Repeat the data backup after removing
the tools from the buffer magazine.

22071 [TO unit %1: ] Tool %2 is active, but not in the magazine area under consideration
Parameters: %1 = TO unit
%2 = Tool identifier
%3 = -Not usedExplanation: The alarm can only occur when the tool management function is active in the NCK. Either the language command SETTA
has been programmed or the corresponding operator action has been carried out via MMC, PLC, .... The alarm can also
be triggered automatically by the NCK in the wear grouping function. It is detected that more than one tool from the tool
group (tools with the same name/identifier) has the status "active".
The specified tool is either
from a non-considered magazine,
from a non-considered wear grouping,
or from a non-active wear grouping
in a buffer location (is neither magazine nor wear grouping).
Reaction: Interface signals are set.
Alarm display.
Remedy: The alarm is intended for information purposes. If only one tool in a group can be active at a time for technological reasons
or for reasons of display, the "active" status must be canceled for the tool causing the error.
Otherwise, the alarm can be ignored or even suppressed via the MD11410 $MN_SUPPRESS_ALARM_MASK.
Typical reasons of display are present, if the operator works with the function 'definite D numbers', which can be displayed
on Siemens MMC in a definite form only, if exactly one tool from a tool group has the status 'active'.
Before machining can be started or before the SETTA (or corresponding MMC operation, ...) language command is used,
all tools of the magazine should have the status "not active".
One option to achieve this is programming SETTIA (or corresponding MMC operation, ...).

25011 Axis %1 pollution of passive encoder
Parameters: %1 = Axis name, spindle number
Explanation: The encoder not used for position control sends a contamination signal (only in measuring systems with contamination
signal).
For PROFIdrive only:

25020 Axis %1 zero mark monitoring of active encoder
Parameters: %1 = Axis name, spindle number
Explanation: For PROFIdrive:
The position encoder pulses between 2 zero mark pulses are counted, and the plausibility is assessed (The functionality
and possibly the parameterization of the plausibility check is done on the drive side. Please refer to the relevant drive
documentation for details.), and reported in a PROFIdrive message frame (encoder interface) to the control, which then
issues the present alarm.

The differences can result from transmission errors, disturbances, encoder hardware faults or from the evaluation
electronics in the encoder used for position control. The actual value branch must therefore be checked:
1. Transmission path: Check the actual-value connectors for correct contacting, encoder cable for continuity, and also
check for short-circuits and grounding (loose contact?).
2. Encoder pulses: Is the encoder power supply within the tolerance limits?
3. Evaluation electronics: Replace or reconfigure the drive or encoder module used.
4. Check MD34220 $MA_ENC_ABS_TURNS_MODULO and Sinamics drive parameter P0979 subindex 5 (or 15,25). They
have to be the same for correct handling of the encoder data.
Monitoring can be switched off by setting MD36310 $MA_ENC_ZERO_MONITORING [n] to 0 or 100 (n = encoder number:

25022 Axis %1 encoder %2 warning %3
Parameters: %1 = Axis name, spindle number
%2 = Encoder number
%3 = Error fine coding
Explanation: This alarm only occurs with absolute encoders:
a. Warning notice of missing absolute encoder adjustment (on the SIMODRIVE 611D or with PROFIdrive drives), that is
if MD34210 $MA_ENC_REFP_STATE equals 0. In this case, fine error code 0 is returned.
b. Only on the SIMODRIVE 611D if zero mark monitoring has been activated for the absolute encoder (see MD36310
$MA_ENC_ZERO_MONITORING): In this case, the absolute position of the absolute encoder could not be read without
error:
Breakdown of fine error codes:
(Bit 0 not used)
Bit 1 Parity error
Bit 2 Alarm bit of the encoder
Bit 3 CRC error
Bit 4 Timeout - start bit for EnDat transfer is missing
This alarm is only displayed, as the absolute position itself is not required at this time for control/contour.
A frequent occurrance of this alarm indicates that the absolute encoder transfer or the absolute encoder itself is faulty,
and that an incorrect absolute value could be determined in one of the next encoder selection or power on situations.
Reaction: Alarm display.
Remedy: a. Verify encoder adjustment (machine reference ) or readjust encoder.
b. Replace the encoder, replace or screen the encoder cable (or deactivate zero mark monitoring).

25030 Axis %1 actual velocity alarm limit
Parameters: %1 = Axis name, spindle number
Explanation: If the axis has at least one active encoder, then the actual speed of the axis is cyclically checked in the IPO cycle. If there
are no errors, the actual velocity can never become greater than specified in the axis-specific MD36200
$MA_AX_VELO_LIMIT (threshold for velocity monitoring). This threshold value in [mm/min, rev/min] is input by an amount
that is about 5 to 10% greater than that which can occur at maximum traversing velocity. Drive errors can result in the
velocity being exceeded and the alarm is then triggered.
The alarm can be reprogrammed in the MD11412 $MN_ALARM_REACTION_CHAN_NOREADY (channel not ready).

25040 Axis %1 standstill monitoring
Parameters: %1 = Axis name, spindle number
Explanation: The NC monitors to ensure that the position is held at zero speed. Monitoring is started after a time that can be set for a
specific axis in the MD36040 $MA_STANDSTILL_DELAY_TIME after interpolation has ended. A constant check is made
to determine whether the axis remains within the tolerance range given in MD36030 $MA_STANDSTILL_POS_TOL.
The following cases are possible:
1. The NC/PLC interface signal DB31, ... DBX2.1 (Servo enable) is zero because the axis has jammed mechanically. Due
to mechanical influences (e.g. high machining pressure), the axis is pushed outside the permissible position tolerance.
2. With closed position control loop (without jamming) - NC/PLC interface signal DB31, ... DBX2.1 (Servo enable) is "1" -
the axis is pushed away from its position by mechanical forces with a small gain in the position control loop.

$MA_STOP_LIMIT_COARSE).
- Estimate machining forces and reduce if necessary by setting a lower feed or a higher rotational speed.
- Increase clamping pressure.
- Increase the gain in the position control loop by improved optimization (Kv factor MD32200 $MA_POSCTRL_GAIN).

NC alarms
Alarms
Diagnostics Manual, 01/2015, 6FC5398-6BP40-5BA2 437
Explanation: The speed setpoint has exceeded its upper limit for a longer period than allowed.
The maximum speed setpoint is limited to a certain percentage by the axis-specific MD36210 $MA_CTRLOUT_LIMIT. The
input value of 100% corresponds to the rated speed of the motor and hence the rapid traverse velocity (exemplary default
value: 840D=110%).
For SINAMICS: Drive parameter p1082 also has a limiting effect.
If the values are exceeded for a short time, then this is tolerated provided they do not last longer than allowed for in the
axis-specific MD36220 $MA_CTRLOUT_LIMIT_TIME. The setpoint is limited during this time to the maximum value that
has been set in (MD36210 $MA_CTRLOUT_LIMIT).

25070 Axis %1 drift value too large
Parameters: %1 = Axis name, spindle number
Explanation: Only with analog drives!
The permissible maximum value of drift (internal, integrated drift value of automatic drift compensation) was exceeded
during the last compensation operation. The permissible maximum value is defined in the axis-specific MD36710
$MA_DRIFT_LIMIT. The drift value itself is not limited.
Automatic drift compensation: MD36700 $MA_DRIFT_ENABLE=1
The difference between actual and setpoint position (drift) is checked cyclically in the IPO cycle when the axes are at zero
speed. The difference is automatically compensated to zero by slowly integrating an internal drift value.
Drift compensation by hand: MD36700 $MA_DRIFT_ENABLE=0
A static offset can be added to the speed setpoint in the MD36720 $MA_DRIFT_VALUE. This is not included in the drift
monitoring because it acts like a voltage work offset.
Reaction: Alarm display.
Remedy: Please inform the authorized personnel/service department. Adjust the drift compensation with the automatic drift
compensation switched off at the drive until the position lag is approximately zero. Then reactivate the automatic drift
compensation in order to balance out the dynamic drift changes (effects of heating up).

25100 Axis %1 measuring system switchover not possible
Parameters: %1 = Axis name, spindle number
Explanation: The prerequisites are not satisfied for the required encoder switchover:
1. The newly selected encoder must be in the active state: (DB31, ... DBX1.5 / 1.6 = 1 (Position measuring system 1/2).
2. The actual value difference between the two encoders is greater than the value in the axis-specific MD36500
$MA_ENC_CHANGE_TOL ("Maximum tolerance for position actual value switchover").
Activation of the measuring system concerned takes place in accordance with the NC/PLC interface signals DB31, ...
DBX1.5 (Position measuring system 1) and DB31, ... DBX1.6 (Position measuring system 2), i.e. the position control is
now operated with this measuring system. The other measuring system is switched over to follow-up mode. If both interface
signals are set to "1", then only the 1st measuring system is active; if both interface signals are set to "0", the axis is parked.
Changeover takes place as soon as the interface signals have changed, even if the axis is in motion.
Reaction: NC Start disable in this channel.
Interface signals are set.
Alarm display.
NC Stop on alarm.
Remedy: Please inform the authorized personnel/service department. When referencing the active position actual value encoder,
the actual value system of the inactive encoder is set to the same reference point value as soon as phase 3 has been
concluded. A later positional difference between the two actual value systems can have occurred only as the result of an
encoder defect or a mechanical displacement between the encoders.
- Check the encoder signals, actual value cable, connectors.
- Check the mechanical fastenings (displacement of the measuring head, mechanical twisting possible).
- Increase the axis-specific MD 36500 $MA_ENC_CHANGE_TOL.

442 Diagnostics Manual, 01/2015, 6FC5398-6BP40-5BA2
Explanation: 1. Rotary measuring system (MD31000 $MA_ENC_IS_LINEAR[]==FALSE)
The number of encoder marks set in MD31020 $MA_ENC_RESOL[] does not correspond to the value in the drive machine
data (PROFIdrive: p979) or zero has been entered in one of the two machine data.
2. Absolute measuring system with EnDat interface (MD30240 $MA_ENC_TYPE[]==4)
On absolute encoders, the resolution of the incremental and absolute tracks supplied by the drive is also checked for
consistency.
For PROFIdrive drives:
Compare drive parameter p979 (and possibly other internal drive, manufacture-specific parameters stated in the relevant
drive documentation) or compare images in NC-MDs $MA_ENC_RESOL, $MA_ENC_PULSE_MULT,
$MA_ENC_ABS_TURNS_MODULO etc.
Conditions leading to triggering the alarm are:
* Number of encoder pulses in the drive!= $MA_ENC_RESOL
* PROFIdrive interface standardization/high resolution in p979 not permitted (permitted pushing factor 0...30 bits)
* With absolute encoders: Interface formats in p979 for absolute and incremental information does not fit together (i.e. the
absolute position in XIST2 is supplied in too coarse resolution for a complete position reconstruction)
* In the case of rotary absolue encoders behind the gears (and activer traversing range extension in accordance with
$MA_ENC_ABS_BUFFERING): Absolute position format (in Gx_XIST2) is complete/sufficient for position reconstruction
via PowerOff in accordance with the following condition: $MA_ENC_RESOL*$MA_ENC_PULSE_MULT*
$MA_ENC_ABS_TURNS_MODULO must not be smaller than 2**32. A remedy against alarm triggering in the latter case
may be to increase $MA_ENC_PULSE_MULT (or the associated drive-side parameterization e.g. p418/419 with
SINAMICS) or (when the necessary conditions prevail) by deactivating the traversing range extension - see

26005 Axis %1 parameterization error: output rating
Parameters: %1 = Axis name, spindle number
Explanation: For analog drives:
The output evaluation of the analog speed setpoint set in the MD32250 $MA_RATED_OUTVAL or in MD 32260
$MA_RATED_VELO is zero.
The effective output evaluation of the speed setpoint interface is zero:
a. MD32260 $MA_RATED_VELO is zero although a standardizing reference value needs to be defined on account of the
setting MD32250 $MA_RATED_OUTVAL>0
b. The corresponding drive-side standardizing parameter is zero, invalid or unreadable/unavailable although an automatic
interface scaling adjustment has been selected on account of MD32250 $MA_RATED_OUTVAL=0.
The drive parameter defining the standard is not determined by PROFIdrive, but is specific to the manufacturer (see the
relevant drive documentation: For SINAMICS: p2000).

26010 Axis %1 QEC: invalid acceleration characteristic
Parameters: %1 = Axis name, spindle number
Explanation: $AA_QEC_ACCEL_1/2/3: The acceleration characteristic is divided into three areas. In each area there is a different
quantization of the acceleration steps. The defaults should be changed only if compensation is inadequate in these
acceleration areas.
The defaults are as follows:
- $AA_QEC_ACCEL_1 with approx. 2% of maximum acceleration ($AA_QEC_ACCEL_3),
- $AA_QEC_ACCEL_2 with approx. 60% of maximum acceleration ($AA_QEC_ACCEL_3),
- $AA_QEC_ACCEL_3 with maximum acceleration (MD32300 $MA_MAX_AX_ACCEL).
Reaction: Alarm display.

26011 Axis %1 QEC: invalid measuring periods
Parameters: %1 = Axis name, spindle number
Explanation: $AA_QEC_MEAS_TIME_1/2/3: measuring time to determine the error criterion.
The measuring period begins when the criterion for activating the compensation value has been satisfied (the desired
velocity changes the sign). The end is defined by the machine data values. In general, different measuring times are
required for the three characteristic ranges. The presettings should be changed only if a problem occurs. The three data
apply in each case for the three corresponding acceleration ranges.
1. $AA_QEC_MEAS_TIME_1 specifies the measuring time (for determining the error criterion) for accelerations in the
range between 0 and $AA_QEC_ACCEL_1.
2. $AA_QEC_MEAS_TIME_2 specifies the measuring time in the range from $AA_QEC_ACCEL_1 to
$AA_QEC_ACCEL_2.
3. $AA_QEC_MEAS_TIME_3 specifies the measuring time in the range from $AA_QEC_ACCEL_2 to $AA_QEC_ACCEL_3
and beyond.
Reaction: Alarm display.

26051 [Channel %1: ] In block %2 unanticipated stop crossed in continuous path mode
Parameters: %1 = Channel number
%2 = Block number, label
Explanation: The path interpolation did not stop, as required, at the end of the block, but will only decelerate to a standstill in the next
block. This error situation occurs if the stop at block change was not planned by the path interpolation or was not detected
early enough. A possible cause is that the PLC changed the spindle speed when MD35500
$MA_SPIND_ON_SPEED_AT_IPO_START > 0, and the machine has to wait until the spindle has returned to the setpoint
range. Another possible cause is that a synchronized action needs to be finished before the path interpolation continues.
The alarm is only output if MD11400 $MN_TRACE_SELECT = 'H400'. The alarm output is normally suppressed. - MD11400
$MN_TRACE_SELECT has SIEMENS password protection.
Reaction: Alarm display.
Remedy: MD35500 $MA_SPIND_ON_SPEED_AT_IPO_START = 1. Program G09 before the alarm output in the block to allow the

Parameters: %1 = Channel number

NC alarms
Alarms
452 Diagnostics Manual, 01/2015, 6FC5398-6BP40-5BA2
Explanation: This alarm usually occurs in a block with auxiliary function output during a movement. In this case, the wait for
acknowledgement of the auxiliary function was longer than planned.
The alarm also occurs if internal control inconsistencies cause continuous path mode (G64, G641, ...) to be blocked
unexpectedly.
The path interpolation stops abruptly at the end of the block indicated in the message (regenerative stop). Alarm 21620 is
often triggered as a follow-up alarm. If not, the path continues after the block change.
Reaction: Alarm display.
Remedy: - The time calculated for the auxiliary function output during the movement comes from the PLC in most systems. Otherwise,
MD10110 $MN_PLC_CYCLE_TIME_AVERAGE is used for this purpose.
- The alarm can basically be avoided by programming in the block G09 indicated in the message. This stops the path
interpolation briefly at the end of the block.

wrong results can occur if the axis was moved after the control was switched off, with the result that the standstill position
saved prior to switching off is no longer correct. To make sure that this does not happen, the user must acknowledge the
displayed actual position after the first referencing process.
When the user enable has first been set, follow-up referencing must be carried out each time the control is booted (with
absolute encoders, this follow-up referencing is executed automatically). This procedure is carried out to verify the standstill
position saved prior to switching off of the control.
Via the MD10094 $MN_SAFE_ALARM_SUPPRESS_LEVEL (MD>=3), the alarm display can be set in such a way that
the group alarm 27100 is displayed for all SI axes.
Reaction: Alarm display.
SGA "Axis safely referenced" is not set. SE will be switched off, if the actual safety position has not yet been confirmed
by a user agreement. If the user agreement has been set, SE will remain active. The safe cams are calculated and output.
However, their significance is limited as referencing has not been confirmed.
Remedy: Traverse the axis to a known position, change to operating mode "Referencing" and press softkey "Agreement". Check
the positions displayed in the agreement screen on the machine. If they match the expected or known position, confirm
this by using the toggle key. If the user agreement has already been set, reference the axis again.
The user agreement can be changed only via keyswitch position 3 or after password entry.
WARNING:
If the axis is not referenced safely and the user agreement is not available, the following will apply:
- the safe cams are not yet safe
- the safe end positions are not yet active.
Programm
continuation:
Alarm display showing cause of alarm disappears. No further operator action necessary.

Explanation: A mutual comparison of the state of the safety-related monitoring functions is made cyclically between the two monitoring
channels (NCK and drive). The comparison is performed separately for each NCK/drive combination.
In each monitoring cycle (MD10091 $MN_INFO_SAFETY_CYCLE_TIME), one criterion from a comparison list is compared
between NCK and drive. In the next monitoring cycle, the next criterion is compared, etc. Once the complete comparison
list has been processed, processing of the comparisons starts again. The resulting total comparison time for processing
the list is displayed in MD10092 $MN_INFO_CROSSCHECK_CYCLE_TIME (factor x MD10091
$MN_INFO_SAFETY_CYCLE_TIME - the factor may differ in the various software versions).
The alarm "Fault in a monitoring channel" is output if the mutual comparison of the two monitoring channels finds a
difference between input data or monitoring results. One of the monitors is no longer functioning reliably.
The cross-check index output in the alarm text is also named the STOP F code. The STOP F code where the NCK found
the first cross-check error is also output in alarm 27001.
The STOP F code of the drive (belonging to alarm C01711) can be found on the diagnostic display or in parameter r9795.
If there is a difference over multiple comparison steps, a number of STOP F code values can be displayed at these points
one after the other).
Divisor..//
There are fault profiles that can be detected by several comparisons in the comparison list, i.e. the displayed STOP F code
value does not always provide clear information about the error cause. The relevant procedure is explained with the
individual error codes:
- 0 No error found in this channel; following alarm to drive alarm C01711.
- 1 Result list 1: Difference in SBH, SG, SBR or SE result, e.g. due to inconsistent activation of the monitoring channels.
For further information, see drive parameters r9710[0], r9710[1].

Remedy: Find the difference between the monitoring channels. Error code shows the cause of the alarm.
It may be the case that safety-relevant machine data is no longer consistent (reload if so) or
that the safety-relevant inputs do not have the same level (check).
If an error of this nature cannot be found, an error may have occurred in the CPU (a memory cell may have "tipped over",
for example). This error may be temporary (remove with power-on) or permanent (replace hardware if the error is displayed
again after power-on).
Error codes for STOP F:
0: No errors in this channel. Look for the cause in the other channel.

27004 Axis %1, difference safe input %2, NCK %3, drive %4
Parameters: %1 = Axis name, spindle number
%2 = Monitoring input
%3 = Interface identifier NCK input
%4 = Interface identifier drive input
Explanation: A difference has been found at the specified safe input. The state of the specified input signal differed in the two monitoring
channels NCK and drive for the duration set in MD36950 $MA_SAFE_MODE_SWITCH_TIME.
Monitoring affected:
SS/SV = Difference in SGE "Deselection of safe operating stop/Safe velocity"
SS = Difference in SGE "Safe operating stop"
SV = Difference in SGEs "Selection safe velocity"
SP = Difference in SGE "Selection safe limit positions"
SVOVR = Difference in SGEs "Selection SG correction"
Interface identifier NCK input (SPL interface):
<io> = Parameterizable system variable range (01=$A_INSID, 02=$A_INSED)
<dword> = System variable double word (1...6)
<bit> = Bit number in system variable double word (1...32)
<value> = Value of NCK SGE (0,1)
Interface identifier drive input:
DBX<byte><bit>=<value >
<byte> = Byte number in axis-specific DB (22, 23, 32, 33)
<bit> = Bit number in byte (0...7)
<value> = Value of drive SGE (0,1)
This alarm can be masked by setting MD10096 $MN_SAFE_DIAGNOSIS_MASK, bit 0 = 0.
Reaction: Alarm display.
Remedy: Check settings for safe input signals (SPL parameterization, PLC DB parameters).
Programm
continuation:
Clear alarm with the RESET key. Restart part program
27005 Axis %1 error in data cross check: static actual value difference
Parameters: %1 = Axis name, spindle number
Explanation: Via the data cross check between NCK and drive monitoring channel, a difference in actual values was detected, which
is greater than the maximum tolerance defined in MD36942 $MA_SAFE_POS_TOL. This can be checked by means of
the safe position values for the two monitoring channels displayed in the service menu.
The alarm is displayed only, if monitoring with absolute reference (SE/SN) has been enabled for the specified axis and if
the user enable has been set. The alarm is cleared, as soon as the user enable is deleted or the actual value difference
between the two monitoring channels falls again below the maximum permissible difference.
Reaction: Alarm display.
Remedy: If the alarm is present statically, the user enable must be deleted. When the control is then rebooted, the machine can be
brought to the safe state again and operation resumed by a new referencing process and setting of the user enable. Prior
to setting the user enable, the actual position of the axis displayed in the "User enable" screen must be compared with the
current machine position. This is obligatory to ensure the proper functioning of the safe limit positions (SE) and safe cams
(SN).
A change of the user acknowledgement is only possible with key switch position 3 or after input of a password.

27032 Axis %1 checksum error of safe monitoring. Confirmation and acceptance test required.
Parameters: %1 = Axis name, spindle number
Explanation: The relevant MDs for parameterization of the axis-specific safety functionality are protected by a checksum. The alarm
indicates that the current checksum no longer corresponds to the stored checksum, this means that an MD has either
been changed without authorization or is faulty.
In the setup phase (SPL setup mode active), instead of the axis-specific checksum single alarms (27032, 27035, and
27060), the axis-specific group alarm 27132 is displayed. In MD10094 $MN_SAFE_ALARM_SUPPRESS_LEVEL, the

NC alarms
Alarms
Diagnostics Manual, 01/2015, 6FC5398-6BP40-5BA2 497
Explanation: The parameterization of the specified machine data is incorrect. An additional indication is the array index of the machine
data. If the machine data is a single machine data item, a zero is specified as the array index. This alarm occurs in the
following contexts:
- Conversion of the specified MD to the internal calculation format causes an overflow.
- Error in parameterization of the input/output assignments for the SGEs/SGAs.
- One of the activated cam positions is outside the actual value modulo range.
- The function "actual value synchronization 2-encoder system" (slip) has been selected for a 1-encoder system, or a
function with an absolute reference (SE/SN) has been selected at the same time.
- A safety function has been enabled in MD36901 $MA_SAFE_FUNCTION_ENABLE although the safety functions SBH/
SG have not be enabled.
- An axis-specific SGE/SGA has been parameterized on the SPL interface (segment number = 4) and the function enable
for the external stops (MD36901 $MA_SAFE_FUNCTION_ENABLE, bit 6) is missing.
- In MD36901 $MA_SAFE_FUNCTION_ENABLE, the cam synchronization has been activated via bit 7 although cams
have not been enabled in bit 8...15.
- In MD36960 $MA_SAFE_STANDSTILL_VELO_TOL, a value greater than 1000 mm/min has been entered for a linear
axis.
- In MD36949 $MA_SAFE_SLIP_VELO_TOL, a value greater than 1000 mm/min has been entered for a linear axis.
- In MD36942 $MA_SAFE_POS_TOL, a value greater than 10mm has been entered for a linear axis.
- In MD36944 $MA_SAFE_REFP_POS_TOL, a value greater than 1mm has been entered for a linear axis.
- In MD36946 $MA_SAFE_VELO_X, a value greater than 1000 mm/min has been entered for a linear axis.
- A zero has been entered in MD36917 $MA_SAFE_ENC_GRID_POINT_DIST.
- A zero has been entered in MD36918 $MA_SAFE_ENC_RESOL.
- The parameterized modulo range MD36905 $MA_SAFE_MODULO_RANGE is not an integer multiple of 360 degrees.
- An axis-specific SGE/SGA was parameterized on the SPL interface (segment number = 4) and SGE "Deselection ext.
stop A" (assigned via MD36977 $MA_SAFE_EXT_STOP_INPUT[0]) has been parameterized inverted (bit 31 = 1) or SGE
"Deselection ext. stop A" has not been parameterized on the SPL interface $A_OUTSI.
- MD10097 $MN_SAFE_SPL_STOP_MODE has been parameterized on value 4 (stop E) although the external stop E has
not been enabled on all axes with SI function enables (MD36901 $MA_SAFE_FUNCTION_ENABLE not equal to 0).
- In MD36907 $MA_SAFE_DRIVE_PS_ADDRESS, an invalid value has been parameterized or the same address has
been assigned to multiple axes.
- The internal preassignment of MD36919 $MA_SAFE_ENC_PULSE_SHIFT from the drive parameterization was not
possible because values would have to be set outside the permissible range. Adjust the encoder parameterization in the
drive.
- MD36932 $MA_SAFE_VELO_OVR_FACTOR has been parameterized with decimal places.
- The value entered in MD36934 $MA_SAFE_POS_LIMIT_PLUS and MD36935 $MA_SAFE_POS_LIMIT_MINUS have
been swapped. The upper limit is less than or equal to the lower limit.
- In MD30300 $MA_IS_ROT_AX and MD36902 $MA_SAFE_IS_ROT_AX, various settings have been made.
- The parameterized cam modulo range MD36905 $MA_SAFE_MODULO_RANGE and the modulo range in MD30330
$MA_MODULO_RANGE are not divisible by one another with an integer result.
- In MD37000 $MA_FIXED_STOP_MODE, testing of the brake mechanism has been enabled (Bit 1 = 1) although safe
operation has not been enabled for this axis in MD36901 $MA_SAFE_FUNCTION_ENABLE. Testing of the brake
mechanism is only permissible with safety functions in this axis.
- MD36961 $MA_SAFE_VELO_STOP_MODE or MD36963 $MA_SAFE_VELO_STOP_REACTION has been
parameterized with an impermissible value.
- Alarms 27000/F01797 are to be suppressed during parking (MD36965 $MA_SAFE_PARK_ALARM_SUPPRESS!=0).
For this, SGA "Axis safely referenced" must be parameterized in MD36987 $MA_SAFE_REFP_STATUS_OUTPUT.
- The logical base address configured in Step 7 and addressed in MD36906 $MA_SAFE_CTRLOUT_MODULE_NR,
MD10393 $MN_SAFE_DRIVE_LOGIC_ADDRESS do not match, or the slot addressed in this way has the wrong length.
- Cam position MD36936 $MA_SAFE_CAM_POS_PLUS[n] or MD36937 $MA_SAFE_CAM_POS_MINUS[n] is
parameterized too near to the modulo limit.
- In MD36901 $MA_SAFE_FUNCTION_ENABLE, "Safe cams" are enabled in bit 8...15, while in MD36903
$MA_SAFE_CAM_ENABLE the function "Safe cam track" is enabled.
- Minus cam position MD36937 $MA_SAFE_CAM_POS_MINUS[n] is greater than the plus cam position MD36936
$MA_SAFE_CAM_POS_PLUS[n]. This is not allowed for the function "Safe cam track."
- The distance between 2 cams on one cam track (MD36937 $MA_SAFE_CAM_POS_MINUS[n] and MD36936
$MA_SAFE_CAM_POS_PLUS[m]) is too small. ("Safe cam track" function)

- Cam modulo functionality has been selected in MD36905 $MA_SAFE_MODULO_RANGE although this is not supported
for the "Safe cam track" function.
- The parameterized monitoring cycle time MD10091 $MN_INFO_SAFETY_CYCLE_TIME does not match the monitoring
cycle time parmeterized in the drive monitoring channel (p9500).
- The velocity hysteresis n<nx in MD36947 $MA_SAFE_VELO_X_HYSTERESIS is greater than half the velocity limit n<nx
in MD36947 $MA_SAFE_VELO_X.
- The velocity tolerance n<nx in MD36947 $MA_SAFE_VELO_X_HYSTERESIS is less than the slip tolerance in MD36949
$MA_SAFE_SLIP_VELO_TOL.
- An axis-specific SGE/SGA addresses the SPL interface outside of the scope release via the relevant option.
- The total encoder resolution (combination of coarse and fine resolution in MD36918 $MA_SAFE_ENC_RESOL and
MD36919 $MA_SAFE_ENC_PULSE_SHIFT) is invalid or exceeds the supported actual value format.
- Simultaneous enable of NC-controlled brake test and drive-integrated brake test is not permitted.
- For an axis with safety functions, no PROFIdrive drive has been parameterized in MD30100

Explanation: A SINAMICS drive delivers values in a parameter that violates the permissible value range for an NCK machine data or
internal limits. If several drive parameters are listed, there is a problem with the combination of these drive parameters. In
this case, the result of the link is displayed as the value.
The following causes are possible:
r469: Resolution of the absolute position for linear absolute encoders invalid or the ratio between the grid division and
measurement step not binary.
r470: Incorrect number of valid bits of the redundant coarse position value.
r471: Incorrect number of fine resolution bits of the redundant coarse position value.
r472: Incorrect number of relevant bits of the redundant coarse position value or 0".
r470/471/472: shift factor for coarse position bits in the finely resolved actual value result in an illegal value (parameter
values do not match).
r473: Invalid number of non safety-relevant measurement steps in the POS1 position value.
r474: A bit unknown to the NCK is set. At this location, the alarm output can be suppressed using MD10096
$MN_SAFE_DIAGNOSIS_MASK, bit 3 = 1.
r475: Incorrect number of the most significant bit of the redundant coarse position.
r979: Error in the encoder format according to PROFIdrive
r9527: Invalid encoder type
Reaction: Alarm display.
Remedy: Investigate as to why an incorrect value has been entered in the specified drive parameter(s) (e.g. for internal software
errors in the drive, refer to the drive documentation).

Explanation: The parameterization read out by the drive for the SI monitoring functions does not match the NCK parameterization in
the displayed MD. The relevant NCK MD has been adjusted.
The following relation exists between the NCK MDs and the drive parameters:

Remedy: Continue with setup, correct checksum.
- If MD36969 $MA_SAFE_BRAKETEST_TORQUE_NORM is displayed:
 The change to p2003 must be taken into account in the parameterization of MD36969
$MA_SAFE_BRAKETEST_TORQUE. The holding torque to be parameterized for the brake test must be reset.
 MD36969 $MA_SAFE_BRAKETEST_TORQUE = desired test torque of the brake / p2003 * 100.
Then an acceptance test of the functioning of the brake test must be made.

27040 Axis %1 waiting for motor module.
Parameters: %1 = Axis name, spindle number
Explanation: Alarm on ramp-up as long as the motor module is not yet ready for SI.
Communication to the motor module is not yet active on ramp-up, the safety functions are not yet available.
The alarm indication can be set in MD10094 $MN_SAFE_ALARM_SUPPRESS_LEVEL so that only one alarm is displayed
for all axes.
Reaction: Interface signals are set.
Alarm display.
Remedy: The alarm will remain present during ramp-up if the drive does not communicate. Otherwise the alarm will only be displayed
briefly and then deleted automatically.
Possible causes for the continual presence of this alarm:
- The safe motion monitoring is only activated in MD36901 $MA_SAFE_FUNCTION_ENABLE, but not in the corresponding
parameter of the assigned drive (p9501).
- The axis -> drive assignment in MD36906 $MA_SAFE_CTRLOUT_MODULE_NR, MD10393
$MN_SAFE_DRIVE_LOGIC_ADDRESS or p0978 is incorrect.
- PROFIBUS connector has fallen out.

$MN_SAFE_ALARM_SUPPRESS_LEVEL higher or equal to 1).
Remedy: Check the connections between NCK and drive.
Check the configuration of the PROFIBUS telegram (e.g. SI slot configured).
Check the assignment of the NCK SI axis to the SI slot (MD36906 $MA_SAFE_CTRLOUT_MODULE_NR, MD10393

504 Diagnostics Manual, 01/2015, 6FC5398-6BP40-5BA2
Explanation: Differences in the compared data have been found in a cyclic data cross-check between NCK and PLC. Parameter %1
indicates the incorrect system variable ($A_INSI, $A_OUTSI, $A_INSE, $A_OUTSE, or $A_MARKERSI) with array index
%2.
Special cases:
- Display "Error in NCK-PLC data cross-check, $MN_PREVENT_SYNACT_LOCK[0], ..." means that the SPL setup status
has been set differently in the NCK and PLC.
- Display "Error in NCK-PLC data cross-check, $MN_SAFE_SPL_STOP_MODE[0], ..." means that the SPL stop reaction
(Stop D or E) has been set differently in the NCK and PLC.
- Display "Error in NCK-PLC data cross-check, $MN_SAFE_SPL_USER_DATA[n], ..." means that different user data have
been set in NCK and PLC.
- Display "Error in NCK-PLC data cross-check, TIMEOUT[0], NCK: 0" means that the communication between NCK and
PLC is generally disturbed and that a data cross-check can no longer be performed.
- Display "Error in NCK-PLC data cross-check, $A_FSDP_ERR_REAC[n], $A_FRDP_SUBS[n],
$A_FRDP_ERR_REAC[n]..." means that different system variables have been specified in NCK and PLC.
With alarm parameter %4, a specific alarm message can be configured on the HMI for all listed system variables:
- 0: Error SPL commissioning status ($MN_PREVENT_SYNACT_LOCK[0,1] - DB18 DBX36.0)
- 0: Error SPL stop reaction ($MN_SAFE_SPL_STOP_MODE - DB18 DBX36.1).
- 0: Error SPL user data ($MN_SAFE_SPL_USER_DATA - DB18 DBD256,260,264,268)
- 0: Error FSENDDP error reaction ($A_FSDP_ERR_REAC[n] - DB18 DBW190, DBW210, DBW220, DBW448,
DBW458 ... DBW568)
- 0: Error FRECVDP error reaction ($A_FRDP_ERR_REAC[n] - DB18 DBW222, DBW234, DBW246, DBW580,
DBW592 ... DBW724)
- 0: Error FRECVDP replacement values ($A_FRDP_SUBS[n] - DB18 DBW220, DBW232, DBW244, DBW578,
DBW590 ... DBW722)
- 1.... 64: Error in system variable $A_INSE[1...64]
- 65...128: Error in system variable $A_OUTSE[1...64]
- 129...192: Error in system variable $A_INSI[1...64]
- 193...256: Error in system variable $A_OUTSI[1...64]
- 257...320: Error in system variable $A_MARKERSI[1...64]

- 449...576: Error in system variable $A_OUTSE[65...192]
- 577...704: Error in system variable $A_INSI[65...192]
- 705...832: Error in system variable $A_OUTSI[65...192]
- 833...960: Error in system variable $A_MARKERSI[65...192]
In order to parameterize alarm 27090, file ALSI_xx.com must be incorporated in the data management and declared in
the HMI with an entry in MBDDE.INI in section[IndexTextFiles] ALSI=f:\dh\mb.dir\alsi_. The machine manufacturer can
redefine this file to incorporate additional texts in the alarm that are useful for its system. If the file is redefined, the newly
created file must be declared in the system with an entry in MBDDE.INI.
The display of alarm 27090 can be modified via MD10094 $MN_SAFE_ALARM_SUPPRESS_LEVEL: MD10094
$MN_SAFE_ALARM_SUPPRESS_LEVEL = 2 : Alarm 27090 will now only be displayed for the first data difference found.
Reaction: Alarm display.
Trigger a STOP D/E (settable via MD10097 $MN_SAFE_SPL_STOP_MODE) on all axes with safety functionality, as soon
as the SPL setup phase (MD11500 $MN_PREVENT_SYNACT_LOCK[0,1] unequal to 0) is completed.
Remedy: Analyze the value displayed and evaluate DB18: SPL_DELTA on the PLC side.
Find the difference between the monitoring channels. Possible causes:
- Incorrect wiring
- Incorrect SPL
- Incorrect assignment of the axis-specific SGEs to internal interface $A_OUTSI
- Incorrect assignment of the axis-specific SGAs to internal interface $A_INSI
- Incorrect assignment of the SPL SGEs to external interface $A_INSE
- Incorrect assignment of the SPL SGAs to external interface $A_OUTSE
- Different SPL startup status set in NCK and PLC
- Different SPL stop reaction set in NCK and PLC

27093 Checksum error NCK-SPL, %1, %2, %3
Parameters: %1 = Extension indicating the type of error
%2 = Extension indicating the reference variable
%3 = Extension indicating the actual variable
Explanation: A checksum error has occurred in the NCK SPL. The file /_N_CST_DIR/_N_SAFE_SPF has subsequently been modified.
The safe programmable logic (SPL) in the NCK may have been corrupted.
Parameter %1 provides more information about the nature of the modification:
- FILE_LENGTH: The file length has changed.
- FILE_CONTENT: The file content has changed.
- FILE_PROTECTED: Exiting the SPL startup phase has restricted access rights to the file, and these have been violated.
The following information is also displayed in the the alarm text:
- the value calculated as reference (file length, checksum of file content) (%2)
- the actual cyclically calculated value (%3).
Reaction: Alarm display.
Remedy: Check the file and the time of the last modification to the file. Reload the original file and start the monitoring system again
with a PowerOn.

27095 %1 SPL protection not activated
Parameters: %1 = Name of the component on which the protection is not activated (NCK or PLC)
Explanation: The protection features are not activated for the SPL. The setup phase of the SPL is not yet complete. No stop reaction
(Stop D or E) was initiated on an error in data cross-comparison between NCK and PLC.
Reaction: Alarm display.
Remedy: - Remedy for NCK: Activate the protection features with MD11500 $MN_PREVENT_SYNACT_LOCK[0,1]. The number
range of the synchronized action IDs used in the SPL must be entered in this MD.
- Remedy for PLC: Activate the protection features by setting the appropriate data bit in DB18.

27096 SPL start not allowed
Explanation: To start the SPL in the protected state (MD11500 $MN_PREVENT_SYNACT_LOCK[0,1] not equal 0), the Safety Integrated
functionality must first be activated for at least one axis (via MD36901 $MA_SAFE_FUNCTION_ENABLE) and operated
with an active drive. Moreover, at least one SGE/SGA of this axis must have been parameterized for an SPL interface. If
these conditions are not met, it is only possible to operate SPL in the setup state.

Reaction: Alarm display.
Remedy: Find the cause of the failure of the SPL to start. Possible causes may be:
- There is an NC or drive error (e.g. after encoder replacement, EMERGENCY STOP, PROFIsafe alarms)
- There is a syntax error in the SPL
- Safety Integrated alarm present (e.g. "Safe limit position overrun")
- Name or path of SPL for PROG_EVENT Start written incorrectly; make sure upper and lower cases are used correctly
- Simultaneous start of an ASUB and PROG_EVENT, parameterization MD 11602 $MN_ASUP_START_MASK (stop
causes e.g. read-in disable)

27100 At least one axis is not safely referenced
Explanation: There are two reasons for this alarm:
- the machine position of at least one of the axes monitored with SI has not yet been acknowledged by the user, or
- the machine position of at least one of the axes monitored with SI has not yet been verified through follow-up referencing.
Even if the axis is already referenced, there is no confirmation that referencing has supplied the correct result. For example,
wrong results can occur if the axis was moved after the control was switched off, with the result that the standstill position
saved prior to switching off is no longer correct. To make sure that this does not happen, the user must acknowledge the
displayed actual position after the first referencing process.
When the user enable has first been set, follow-up referencing must be carried out each time the control is booted (with
absolute encoders, this follow-up referencing is executed automatically). This procedure is carried out to verify the standstill
position saved prior to switching off of the control.
Via the MD10094 $MN_SAFE_ALARM_SUPPRESS_LEVEL (MD>=3), the alarm display can be set in such a way that an
alarm is given for each axis individually which has not been safely referenced.
Reaction: Alarm display.
SGA "Axis safely referenced" is not set. SE will be switched off, if the actual safety position has not yet been confirmed
by a user agreement. If the user agreement has been set, SE will remain active. The safe cams are calculated and output.
However, their significance is limited as referencing has not been confirmed.
Remedy: Move all SI axes to known positions and change to "Referencing" mode. Check the positions on the machine displayed in
the user confirmation field and set "User confirmation" via the selection/toggle key. If the user confirmation for the axes
has already been set, reference the axes again.
Changing the user confirmation will be possible only in key switch position 3 or after password entry

27140 Waiting for motor module of at least one axis.
Explanation: Alarm during startup as long as the motor module of at least one axis is not yet ready for SI.
Communication with the motor module during startup has not yet been activated; the safety functions of at least one axis
are not yet available.
In MD10094 $MN_SAFE_ALARM_SUPPRESS_LEVEL (MD<3), the alarm display can be set to display for each axis
individually whether communication has been activated.
The alarm persistently occurs during startup if at least one drive is not communicating. Otherwise, the alarm only briefly
appears and is cleared automatically.
Possible causes of the persistent occurrence of the alarm:
- The safe motion monitoring functions are only activated in MD36901 $MA_SAFE_FUNCTION_ENABLE, but not in the
corresponding parameter of the associated drive (p9501).
- The assignment axis -> drive in MD36906 $MA_SAFE_CTRLOUT_MODULE_NR, MD10393

Parameters: %1 = Channel number
%2 = Block number
Explanation: The 3D clearance control has been switched off with CLC(0) while tool radius compensation is still active (G41/G42). Since
CLC(0) empties the internal block buffer and accepts the current traversed position offset of the clearance control as a
"contour jump" in the interpreter, TRC must be deactivated when this command is issued.
Reaction: Interpreter stop
Alarm display.
Remedy: Modify part program: Switch off active G41/G42 before CLC(0) or do not switch of clearance control, but just "freeze"
temporarily (CLC_GAIN=0.0) or cancel the position offset mechanically with CLC(-1).

G19 has been applied as the control direction. Switching on the transformation with rotary axis settings that define a
different tool orientation requires an orientation step change and is therefore rejected.
2. The transformation has been switched off temporarily (TRAFOOF) while clearance control is still active. When the
transformation is switched on again, the tool orientation must be the same as when it was switched off, i.e. the rotary axes
must not be moved while the transformation is deactivated.

75500 [Channel %1: ] HSLC: Configuration error ID=%2
Parameters: %1 = Channel number
Explanation: The function CC_FASTON or CC_FASTON_CONT cannot be executed because the following MD configuration is
incorrect:
ID=2: The NCK system function "Timer-controlled cam signal output" (see Description of Functions "Software cams,
Position switching signals (N3)" ) is configured with machine data MD 10480 $MN_SW_CAM_TIMER_FASTOUT_MASK
> 0 at the same time as the function HSLC. As there is only one hardware timer on the NCU, only one of the two functions
can be used.
ID=4: Programming CC_FASTON and CC_FASTON_CONT requires internal block memory:
In order to activate the compile cycle CCHSLC, the entries have to be increased in the following machine data:
MD 28090 $MC_MM_NUM_CC_BLOCK_ELEMENTS by 1 element
MD 28100 $MC_MM_NUM_CC_BLOCK_USER_MEM by 2 [KB]
Reaction: Alarm display.
Remedy: Modify the stated MD settings
Programm
continuation:

75501 [Channel %1: ] HSLC: CC_FASTON_CONT velocity too high
Parameters: %1 = Channel number
Explanation: The path-related switching signal output switched on by the part rogramm command
CC_FASTON_CONT( PATH_DISTANCE_ON, PATH_DISTANCE_OFF )
cannot output all switching signals correctly at the current velocity.
Reason:
A maximum of one switching edge can be output per IPO cycle (see $MN_IPO_CYCLE_TIME ). The current path velocity
is so high that there is more than one switching edge to be output within one path distance PATH_DISTANCE_ON or
PATH_DISTANCE_OFF.
Example:
IPO cycle = 2ms ( position-control cycle = 1ms )
PATH_DISTANCE_ON = 0.667
PATH_DISTANCE_OFF = 0.667
Maximum path velocity in which no switching edges are lost: 20000 mm/min
When alarm 75501 occurs, the function skips the output of two successive switching edges. This does not affect the position
of subsequent switching edges.
Note: Whether the ommission of a signal from the previous switching signal leaves a high or low level present, is purely
coincidental.
Reaction: Alarm display.
Remedy: - Lengthen the operating travels programmed in the command CC_FASTON_CONT
- Program the path velocity or reduce it with the override switch
- Set a shorter IPO cycle (machine manufacturer only)

75608 [Channel %1: ] RESU: NC memory limit reached, RAM type %2
Explanation: A memory limit was reached on writing to file cc_resu.mpf. The possible area for return traveling is shortened.
RAM type = 1: File cc_resu.mpf is created in the buffer memory (SRAM). The buffer memory is therefore full. If the buffer
memory is used and if alarm 75608 with RAM type 1 is output, system alarm 6500 will be output simultaneously.
RAM type = 2: The memory limit was reached on creating file cc_resu.mpf in the dynamic memory (DRAM part program

120401 SINAMICS: Write job for parameter %1, value %2, area %3: %4s timeout!
Parameters: %1 = Number of parameter the value of which is to be written.
%2 = Value to be written
%3 = Area (drive object class to which the write job was addressed)
%4 = Time passed without the write job being acknowledged by the drive device.
Explanation: The write job of a SINAMICS parameter was not not acknowledged within 10 seconds by the drive device.
If the write job is not acknowledged within the next 10 seconds, the alarm will again be triggered.
The waiting period for the acknowledgement of a write job is a maximum of 130 seconds, i.e. if the timeout specified in
the alarm is 130 seconds, it is assumed that the write job has failed. Otherwise it can be assumed that the write job was
successful despite the timeout.
Reaction: Alarm display.
Remedy: As long as the timeout specified in the alarm is less than 130 seconds, acknowledge alarm, otherwise switch off/on control,

Reaction: NONE
Acknowledge: POWER ON
Cause: Module booting was interrupted several times. As a consequence, the module boots with the factory setting.
Possible reasons for booting being interrupted:
- power supply interrupted.
- CPU crashed.
- parameterization invalid.
Remedy: - carry out a POWER ON (power off/on). After switching on, the module reboots from the valid parameterization (if available).
- restore the valid parameterization.
Examples:
a) Carry out a first commissioning, save, carry out a POWER ON (switch-off/switch-on).
b) Load another valid parameter backup (e.g. from the memory card), save, carry out a POWER ON (switch-off/switch-on).
Note:
If the fault situation is repeated, then this fault is again output after several interrupted boots.

Remedy: - check the DRIVE-CLiQ wiring.
- Reduce the number of components on the DRIVE-CLiQ line involved and distribute these to other DRIVE-CLiQ sockets
of the Control Unit. This means that communication is uniformly distributed over several lines.
Re fault value = 1yy - 4yy in addition:
- increase the sampling times (p0112, p0115, p4099). If necessary, for DCC or FBLOCKS, change the assignment of the
run-time group (p21000, p20000) so that the sampling time (r21001, r20001) is increased.
- if necessary, reduce the number of cyclically calculated blocks (DCC) and/or function blocks (FBLOCKS).
- reduce the function modules (r0108).
- establish the conditions for operation with a current controller sampling time of 31.25 µs (at the DRIVE-CLiQ line, only
operate Motor Modules and Sensor Modules with this sampling time and only use a permitted Sensor Module (e.g. SMC20,
this means a 3 at the last position of the order number)).
- For an NX, the corresponding Sensor Module for a possibly existing second measuring system should be connected to
a free DRIVE-CLiQ socket of the NX.
Re fault value = 8yy in addition:
- check the clock cycles settings (p0112, p0115, p4099). Clock cycles on a DRIVE-CLiQ line must be perfect integer
multiples of one another. As clock cycle on a line, all clock cycles of all drive objects in the previously mentioned parameters
apply, which have components on the line involved.
Re fault value = 9yy in addition:
- check the clock cycles settings (p0112, p0115, p4099). The lower the numerical value difference between two clock
cycles, the higher the lowest common multiple. This behavior has a significantly stronger influence, the higher the numerical
values of the clock cycles.

Remedy: Remove the illegal components and restart the system.
201355 <location>Topology: Actual topology changed
Message value: %1
Drive object: All objects
Reaction: NONE
Acknowledge: IMMEDIATELY
Cause: The device target topology (p0099) does not correspond to the device actual topology (r0098).
The fault only occurs if the topology was commissioned using the automatic internal device mechanism and not using the
commissioning software.
Fault value (r0949, interpret decimal):
Only for internal Siemens troubleshooting.
See also: r0098 (Actual device topology), p0099 (Device target topology)
Remedy: One of the following counter-measures can be selected if no faults have occurred in the topology detection itself:
If commissioning is still not completed:
- carry out a self-commissioning routine (starting from p0009 = 1).
In general:
Set p0099 = r0098, set p0009 = 0; for existing Motor Modules, this results in servo drives being automatically generated
(p0107).
Generating servo drives: Set p0097 to 1, set p0009 to 0.
Generating vector drives: Set p0097 to 2, set p0009 to 0.
Generating vector drives with parallel circuit: Set p0097 to 12, set p0009 to 0.
In order to set configurations in p0108, before setting p0009 to 0, it is possible to first set p0009 to 2 and modify p0108.
The index corresponds to the drive object (p0107).
If commissioning has already been completed:
- re-establish the original connections and re-connect power to the Control Unit.
- restore the factory setting for the complete equipment (all of the drives) and allow automatic self-commissioning again.
- change the device parameterization to match the connections (this is only possible using the commissioning software).
Notice:
Topology changes that result in this fault being generated cannot be accepted by the automatic function in the device, but
must be transferred using the commissioning software and parameter download. The automatic function in the device only
allows constant topology to be used. Otherwise, when the topology is changed, all of the previous parameter settings are
lost and replaced by the factory setting.

Cause: The requested BICO interconnection was established. However, a conversion is made between the BICO output and BICO
input using the reference values.
- the BICO output has different normalized units than the BICO input.
- message only for interconnections within a drive object.
Example:
The BICO output has, as normalized unit, voltage and the BICO input has current.
This means that the factor p2002/p2001 is calculated between the BICO output and the BICO input.

Cause: The requested BICO interconnection was established. However, a conversion is made between the BICO output and BICO
input using the reference values.
An interconnection is made between different drive objects and the BICO output has different normalized units than the
BICO input or the normalized units are the same but the reference values are different.
Example 1:
BICO output with voltage normalized unit, BICO input with current normalized unit, BICO output and BICO input lie in
different drive objects. This means that the factor p2002/p2001 is calculated between the BICO output and the BICO input.
p2002: contains the reference value for current
p2001: contains the reference value for voltage
Example 2:
BICO output with voltage normalized unit in drive object 1 (DO1), BICO input with voltage normalized unit in drive object
2 (DO2). The reference values for voltage (p2001) of the two drive objects have different values. This means that the factor
p2001(DO1)/p2001(DO2) is calculated between the BICO output and the BICO input.
p2001: contains the reference value for voltage, drive objects 1, 2
Fault value (r0949, interpret decimal):

201657 <location>SI P1 (CU): PROFIsafe telegram number invalid
Message value: -
Drive object: HLA, HLA_840, SERVO, SERVO_840, SERVO_AC, VECTOR, VECTOR_AC
Reaction: OFF2
Acknowledge: POWER ON
Cause: The PROFIsafe telegram number set in p9611 is not valid.
When PROFIsafe is enabled (p9601.3 = 1), then a telegram number greater than zero must be entered in p9611.
Note:
This fault does not result in a safety stop response.

Message value: -
Drive object: HLA, HLA_840, SERVO, SERVO_840, SERVO_AC, VECTOR, VECTOR_AC

Acknowledge: IMMEDIATELY (POWER ON)
Cause: The PROFIsafe telegram number is set differently in p9611 and p60022.
For p9611 not equal to 998, the following applies:
The telegram number must be identically set in both parameters.
The following applies for p9611 = 998:
As a result of the compatibility to firmware versions < 4.5, then only the values 0 and 30 are permitted in p60022.
Note:
This fault does not result in a safety stop response.

Message value: -
Drive object: HLA, HLA_840, SERVO, SERVO_840, SERVO_AC, VECTOR, VECTOR_AC
Reaction: OFF2
Acknowledge: IMMEDIATELY (POWER ON)
Cause: In p9700, the value 87 or 208 is saved or was entered offline.
This is the reason that when booting, an attempt is made to copy SI parameters from monitoring channel 1 to monitoring
channel 2. However, no safety-relevant function has been selected on monitoring channel 1 (p9501 = 0, p9601 = 0).
Copying was rejected for safety reasons.
As a consequence, inconsistent parameterization can occur in both monitoring channels, which in turn results in additional
error messages.
Especially for inconsistent enabling of the safety functions on both monitoring channels (p9601 = 0, p9801 <> 0), fault
F30625 is output.
Note:
This fault does not result in a safety stop response.
See also: p9700
Remedy: - Set p9700 to 0.
- Check p9501 and p9601 and if required, correct.
- Restart the copying function by entering the corresponding value into p9700.
Alternatively, using the STARTER commissioning tool, perform the following steps in the online mode:
- Call the "Safety Integrated" screen form (the field "Select safety functions" is at "No Safety Integrated").
- Click on "Change settings".
- Click on "Activate settings" (as a consequence, Safety Integrated is inhibited on both monitoring channels).
- save all parameters (p0977 = 1 or "copy RAM to ROM").
- carry out a POWER ON (power off/on) for all components.

Cause: During booting, the system detected that the "Firmware update automatic" function (p7826 = 1) was not activated.
This function must be activated for automatic firmware updates/downgrades to prevent impermissible version combinations
when safety functions are enabled.
Note:
This fault does not result in a safety stop response.

Remedy: When safety functions are enabled (p9501 <> 0 and/or p9601 <> 0):
1. Activate the "Firmware update automatic" function (p7826 = 1).
2. Save the parameters (p0977 = 1) and carry out a POWER ON.

Cause: A logical 1 signal is present at the F-DI configured in p10006 for more than 10 seconds.
If, at the F-DI no acknowledgment was performed for safe acknowledgment, then a steady-state logical and 0 signal must
be present. This avoids unintentional safety-relevant acknowledgement (or the "Internal Event Acknowledge" signal) if a

Message value: %1
Drive object: HLA, HLA_840, SERVO, SERVO_840, SERVO_AC, VECTOR, VECTOR_AC
Reaction: OFF2
Acknowledge: IMMEDIATELY (POWER ON)
Cause: At least one enabled "Safety Cam" (SCA) is parameterized in p9536 or p9537 too close to the tolerance range around the
modulo position.
The following conditions must be complied with to assign cams to a cam track:
- the cam length of cam x = p9536[x]-p9537[x] must be greater or equal to the cam tolerance + the position tolerance (=
p9540 + p9542). This also means that for cams on a cam track, the minus position value must be less than the plus position
value.
- the distance between 2 cams x and y (minus position value[y] - plus position value[x] = p9537[y] - p9536[x]) on a cam
track must be greater than or equal to the cam tolerance + position tolerance (= p9540 + p9542).
Note:
This fault does not result in a safety stop response.

826 Diagnostics Manual, 01/2015, 6FC5398-6BP40-5BA2
Cause: When cross-comparing the two monitoring channels, the drive detected a difference between the input data or results of
the monitoring functions and initiated a STOP F. One of the monitoring functions no longer reliably functions - i.e. safe
operation is no longer possible.
If at least one monitoring function is active, then after the parameterized timer has expired, the message C01701 "SI
Motion: STOP B initiated" is output.
The message value that resulted in a STOP F is displayed in r9725.
If the drive is operated together with a SINUMERIK, the message values are described in message 27001 of SINUMERIK,
with the exception of the following message values, which can only occur in SINAMICS:
1007: communication error with the PLC (sign-of-life)
1008: communication error with the PLC (CRC)
The following described message values involve the crosswise data comparison between the two monitoring channels
(safety functions integrated in the drive).
The message values may also occur in the following cases if the cause that is explicitly mentioned does not apply:
- cycle times not set uniformly (p9500/p9300 and p9511/p9311)
- excessively fast cycle times (p9500/p9300, p9511/p9311).
- for message values 3, 44 ... 57, 232 and 1-encoder systems, differently parameterized encoder values (p9516/p9316,
p9517/p9317, p9518/p9318, p9520/p9320, p9521/p9321, p9522/p9322, p9526/p9326).
- incorrect synchronization.

Remedy: The following generally applies:
The monitoring clock cycles in both channels and the axis types should be checked for equality and the same setting
applied if necessary. If the error continues to be identified, increasing the monitoring clock cycles may resolve it.
Re message value = 0:
- no error was identified in this monitoring channel. Note the error message of the other monitoring channel (for HM:
C30711).
Re message value = 3:
Commissioning phase:
- Encoder evaluation for own or second channel has been set incorrectly --> Correct the encoder evaluation.
In operation:
- Check the mechanical design and the encoder signals.
Re message value = 4:
The monitoring clock cycles in both channels should be checked for equality and if required, set the same. In combination
with message value 5 from the other monitoring channel (with HM: C30711), the monitoring clock cycle settings must be
increased.
Re message value = 11 ... 14:
- the limit values in p9534/p9334 or p9535/p9335 are not equal or have been set too high. Correct the values.
Re message value = 232:
- Increase the hysteresis tolerance (p9547/p9347). Possibly set the filtering higher (p9545/p9345).
Re message value = 1 ... 999:
- if the message value is listed under cause: Check the crosswise-compared parameters to which the message value
refers.
- copy the safety parameters.
- carry out a POWER ON (power off/on) for all components.
- upgrade the Hydraulic Module software.
- upgrade the Control Unit software.
- correction of the encoder evaluation. The actual values differ as a result of mechanical faults (V belts, travel to a
mechanical endstop, wear and window setting that is too narrow, encoder fault, ...).
Note:
For SINAMICS firmware version >= 4.7, the CDC list is increased when setting p9567 > 0. For a non-compatible version
of SINUMERIK this can lead to an error for the crosswise data comparison (is indicated with message value >= 237). If
necessary, p9567 must be set = 0, or the firmware version of SINUMERIK upgraded.
Re message value = 1000:
- investigate the signal associated with the safety-relevant input (contact problems).
Re message value = 1001:
- carry out a POWER ON (power off/on) for all components.
- upgrade the Hydraulic Module software.
- upgrade the Control Unit software.
Re message value = 1002:
- Perform safe acknowledgment, set the user agreement in both monitoring channels simultaneously (within 4 s).
Re message value = 1003:
- check the mechanical system of the axis. It is possible that the axis was shifted when switched-off, and the last saved
actual position no longer corresponds with the new actual position after the system has been powered up again.
- Increase the tolerance for the actual value comparison when referencing (p9544).
Then check the actual values, perform a POWER ON and set the user agreement again.
Re message value = 1004:
For 1., the following applies: Perform safe acknowledgment. Set the user agreement again.
For 2., the following applies: Perform safe acknowledgment. Only set the user agreement again if the axis has been
referenced.
Re: message value = 1005: deselect checking the conditions for STO.
Re message value = 1007:
- check the PLC for the correct operating state (run state, basic program).
Re message value = 1008:
- check whether incorrect or overlapping address ranges have been set in SINUMERIK machine data MD10393.

If at least one monitoring function is active, then after the parameterized timer has expired, the message C01701 "SI
Motion: STOP B initiated" is output.
The message value that resulted in a STOP F is displayed in r9725.
If the drive is operated together with a SINUMERIK, the message values are described in message 27001 of SINUMERIK,
with the exception of the following message values, which can only occur in SINAMICS:
1007: communication error with the PLC (sign-of-life)
1008: communication error with the PLC (CRC)
The following described message values involve the crosswise data comparison between the two monitoring channels
(safety functions integrated in the drive).
The message values may also occur in the following cases if the cause that is explicitly mentioned does not apply:
- cycle times not set uniformly (p9500/p9300 and p9511/p9311)
- differently parameterized axis types (p9502/p9302).
- excessively fast cycle times (p9500/p9300, p9511/p9311).
- for message values 3, 44 ... 57, 232 and 1-encoder systems, differently parameterized encoder values (p9516/p9316,
p9517/p9317, p9518/p9318, p9520/p9320, p9521/p9321, p9522/p9322, p9526/p9326).

Remedy: The following generally applies:
The monitoring clock cycles in both channels and the axis types should be checked for equality and the same setting
applied if necessary. If the error continues to be identified, increasing the monitoring clock cycles may resolve it.
Re message value = 0:
- no error was identified in this monitoring channel. Note the error message of the other monitoring channel (for MM:
C30711).
Re message value = 3:
Commissioning phase:
- Encoder evaluation for own or second channel has been set incorrectly --> Correct the encoder evaluation.
In operation:
- Check the mechanical design and the encoder signals.
- If closed-loop control with edge modulation is parameterized (p1802[x] = 9): parameterize edge modulation for actual
value sensing without encoder (p9507.5 = p9307.5 = 1).
Re message value = 4:
The monitoring clock cycles in both channels should be checked for equality and if required, set the same. In combination
with message value 5 from the other monitoring channel (with MM: C30711), the monitoring clock cycle settings must be
increased.
Re message value = 11 ... 14:
- the limit values in p9534/p9334 or p9535/p9335 are not equal or have been set too high. Correct the values.
Re message value = 232:
- Increase the hysteresis tolerance (p9547/p9347). Possibly set the filtering higher (p9545/p9345).
Re message value = 1 ... 999:
- if the message value is listed under cause: Check the crosswise-compared parameters to which the message value
refers.
- copy the safety parameters.
- carry out a POWER ON (power off/on) for all components.
- upgrade the Motor Module software.
- upgrade the Control Unit software.
- correction of the encoder evaluation. The actual values differ as a result of mechanical faults (V belts, travel to a
mechanical endstop, wear and window setting that is too narrow, encoder fault, ...).
Note:
For SINAMICS firmware version >= 4.7, the CDC list is increased when setting p9567 > 0. For a non-compatible version
of SINUMERIK this can lead to an error for the crosswise data comparison (is indicated with message value >= 237). If
necessary, p9567 must be set = 0, or the firmware version of SINUMERIK upgraded.
Re message value = 1000:
- investigate the signal associated with the safety-relevant input (contact problems).
Re message value = 1001:
- carry out a POWER ON (power off/on) for all components.
- upgrade the Motor Module software.
- upgrade the Control Unit software.
Re message value = 1002:
- Perform safe acknowledgment, set the user agreement in both monitoring channels simultaneously (within 4 s).
Re message value = 1003:
- check the mechanical system of the axis. It is possible that the axis was shifted when switched-off, and the last saved
actual position no longer corresponds with the new actual position after the system has been powered up again.
- Increase the tolerance for the actual value comparison when referencing (p9544).
Then check the actual values, perform a POWER ON and set the user agreement again.
Re message value = 1004:
For 1., the following applies: Perform safe acknowledgment. Set the user agreement again.
For 2., the following applies: Perform safe acknowledgment. Only set the user agreement again if the axis has been
referenced.
Re message value = 1005:
- For safe motion monitoring functions without encoder: check the conditions for pulse enable.
- For safe motion monitoring functions with encoder: check the conditions for STO deselection.

840 Diagnostics Manual, 01/2015, 6FC5398-6BP40-5BA2
Cause: When cross checking and comparing the two monitoring channels, the drive detected a difference between parameters
or results of the F-IO processing and initiated a STOP F. One of the monitoring functions no longer reliably functions - i.e.
safe operation is no longer possible.
The safety message C01711 with message value 0 is also displayed due to initiation of STOP F.
If at least one monitoring function is active, the safety message C01701 "SI Motion: STOP B initiated" is output after the
parameterized timer has expired.

844 Diagnostics Manual, 01/2015, 6FC5398-6BP40-5BA2
Cause: The fail-safe digital inputs/digital outputs (F-DI/F-DO) show a different state longer than that parameterized in p10002 /
p10102.
Fault value (r0949, interpret bitwise binary):
yyyyxxxx bin
xxxx: Discrepancy error for fail-safe digital inputs (F-DI).
Bit 0: Discrepancy error for F-DI 0
Bit 1: Discrepancy error for F-DI 1
...
yyyy: Discrepancy error for fail-safe digital outputs (F-DO).
Bit 0: Discrepancy error for F-DO 0
...
Note:
If several discrepancy errors occur consecutively, then this message is only signaled for the first error that occurs.
Remedy: - check the wiring of the F-DI (contact problems).
Note:
This message can be acknowledged via F-DI or PROFIsafe.
Discrepancy errors of an F-DI can only be completely acknowledged if safe acknowledgement was carried out once the
cause of the error was resolved (p10006 or acknowledgment via PROFIsafe). As long as safety acknowledgement was
not carried out, the corresponding F-DI stays in the safe state internally.
For cyclic switching operations at the F-DI, it may be necessary to adapt the discrepancy time to the switching frequency.
If the period of a cyclic switching pulse corresponds to twice the value of p10002, then the following formulas should be
checked:
- p10002 < (tp / 2) - td (discrepancy time must be less than half the period minus the actual discrepancy time)
- p10002 >= p9500 (discrepancy time must be no less than p9500)
- p10002 > td (discrepancy time must be greater than the switch discrepancy time which may actually apply)
td = possible actual discrepancy time (in ms) that can occur with a switching operation. This must correspond to at least
1 SI monitoring cycle (see p9500).
tp = period for a switching operation in ms.
When debounce p10017 is active, the discrepancy time is directly specified by the debounce time.
If the period of a cyclic switching pulse corresponds to twice the debounce time, then the following formulas should be
checked.
- p10002 < p10017 + 1 ms - td
- p10002 > td
- p10002 >= p9500
Example:
For a 12 ms SI monitoring cycle and a switching frequency of 110 ms (p10017 = 0), the maximum discrepancy time which
can be set is as follows:
p10002 <= (110/2 ms) - 12 ms = 43 ms
Rounded-off, p10002 <= 36 ms is obtained (since the discrepancy time can only be accepted as a whole SI monitoring
cycle, the value will need to be rounded up or down to a whole SI monitoring cycle if the result is not an exact multiple of
an SI monitoring cycle).

Example:
Fault F01773 (CU) is signaled with fault value = 0001_0127 and fault F30773 (MM) is signaled with fault value 0000_0127.
This means that in state 7 (Z = 7) the state of the external readback signal was not set correctly (Y = 2) after DO-0 (X =
1) was switched to ON/ON.
Fault value 0001_0127 indicates that 0 was expected (W = 0) and 1 (V = 1) was read back from the hardware.
Fault value 0000_0127 on the MM indicates that the states were as expected.
In the case of fault F30773, W and V are always identical; a value of 0 always means that 0 was expected at the readback
input but was not present on the other channel (CU).
Remedy: Check the wiring of the F-DOs and restart the test stop.
Note:
The fault is withdrawn if the test stop is successfully completed.
In the event of multiple test stop faults, the first one that occurred is shown.
Once the test stop has been restarted the next queued test stop fault will be signaled (if there is one).

Cause: - after powering up the drive, a test stop has still not been carried out.
- a new test stop is required after commissioning.
- the time to carry out the forced checking procedure (test stop) has expired (p10003).
Note:
- The test must be performed within a defined, maximum time interval (p10003, maximum of 8760 hours) in order to comply
with the requirements as laid down in the standards for timely fault detection and the conditions to calculate the failure
rates of safety functions (PFH value). Operation beyond this maximum time period is permissible if it can be ensured that
the forced checking procedure is performed before persons enter the hazardous area and who are depending on the safety

Message value: -
Drive object: HLA, HLA_840, SERVO, SERVO_840, SERVO_AC, VECTOR, VECTOR_AC
Reaction: NONE
Acknowledge: NONE
Cause: The STO function is selected via Safety Extended Functions or a safety message is present, which results in STO.
The automatic test stop was not able to be carried out since the power up.
The automatic test stop is performed after deselecting STO.
Remedy: Deselect STO via Safety Extended Functions.

201789 <location>Automatic test stop and brake test not permitted when test stop is selected
Message value: -
Drive object: HLA, HLA_840, SERVO, SERVO_840, SERVO_AC, VECTOR, VECTOR_AC
Reaction: NONE
Acknowledge: NONE
Cause: The parameterization of the automatic test stop (p9507.6/p9307.6) and the brake test when a test stop is selected (p10203
= 2) is not permissible.
The test stop is not automatically carried out when the powering up.
Remedy: - correct the parameter assignment.
- set p10203 not equal to 2 or deactivate the automatic test stop.
Note:
A warm restart or POWER ON is required to carry out the automatic test stop.
201794 <location>SI MOTION: check modulo value for safe position via PROFIsafe
Message value: -
Drive object: HLA, HLA_840, SERVO, SERVO_840, SERVO_AC, VECTOR, VECTOR_AC
Reaction: NONE
Acknowledge: NONE
Cause: When parameterizing the modulo value for safe position via PROFIsafe (p9505) the position actual value can jump when
the range that can be represented overflows.
Range that can be represented:
- 32-bit value: +/- 2048 revolutions
- 16-bit value: +/- 2048 revolutions (depending on p9574)
Remedy: Correct the parameter assignment.
Set p9505 to 2^n revolutions - and to complete revolutions (i.e. a multiple of 360 °).
Note:
This alarm can be hidden for the case that the possible position actual value jump can be tolerated for the particular
application, or does not represent a problem; for example because the parameterized modulo range fits "almost as integer
number" in the range of +/- 2048 revolutions that can be represented.
To re-parameterize the alarm to "NO REPORT", it is not permissible that the alarm is present. As a consequence, the
following sequence is required for the re-parameterization:
- correct p9505 to "2^n".
- re-parameterize the alarm using p2118 and p2119.
- set p9505 back to the required value.

Acknowledge: NONE
Cause: The drive waits for communication to be established to execute the safety-relevant motion monitoring functions.
Note:
STO is active in this state.
Alarm value (r2124, interpret decimal):
1: Wait for communication to be established to SINUMERIK.
2: Wait for communication to be established to TM54F.
3: Wait for communication to be established to PROFIsafe F-Host.
Remedy: If, after a longer period of time, the message is not automatically withdrawn, the following checks have to be made as
appropriate:
For communication with SINUMERIK, the following applies:
- check any other PROFIBUS messages/signals present and remove their cause.
- check that assignment of the axes on the higher-level control to the drives in the drive unit is correct.
- check enable signal of the safety-relevant motion monitoring functions for the corresponding axis on the higher-level
control and if required, set it.
For communication with TM54F, the following applies:
- check any other messages/signals present for DRIVE-CLiQ communication with the TM54F and remove their cause.
- check the setting of p10010. All the drive objects controlled by the TM54F must be listed.
For communication with PROFIsafe F-Host, the following applies:
- Check any other PROFIsafe communication messages/signals present and evaluate them.
- check the operating state of the F-Host.
- Check the communication connection to the F Host.
- Check the communication connection to the Motor Module/Hydraulic Module. It must be ensured that when the Control
Unit powers up, the Motor Module/Hydraulic Module is connected and at the latest is also switched-on with the Control
Unit. Otherwise, if the Motor Module/Hydraulic Module is subsequently inserted or switched-on, a POWER ON must be
performed at the Control Unit.

Reaction: NONE
Acknowledge: NONE
Cause: The bus is in the data exchange state and clock synchronous operation has been selected using the parameterizing
telegram. It was not possible to synchronize to the clock cycle specified by the master.
- the master does not send a clock synchronous global control telegram although clock synchronous operation was selected
when configuring the bus.
- the master is using another clock synchronous DP clock cycle than was transferred to the slave in the parameterizing
telegram.
- at least one drive object has a pulse enable (not controlled from PROFIBUS/PROFINET either).
Remedy: - check the master application and bus configuration.
- check the consistency between the clock cycle input when configuring the slave and clock cycle setting at the master.
- check that no drive object has a pulse enable. Only enable the pulses after synchronizing the PROFIBUS/PROFINET
drives.

202041 <location>Function generator: Illegal value for bandwidth
Message value: -
Drive object: All objects
Reaction: NONE
Acknowledge: NONE
Cause: The bandwidth referred to the time slice clock cycle of the function generator has either been set too low or too high.
Depending on the time slice clock cycle, the bandwidth is defined as follows:
Bandwidth_max = 1 / (2 x time slice clock cycle)
Bandwidth_min = Bandwidth_max / 100000
Example:
Assumption: p4830 = 125 µs
--> Bandwidth_max = 1 / (2 x 125 µs) = 4000 Hz
--> Bandwidth_min = 4000 Hz / 100000 = 0.04 Hz
Note:
p4823: Function generator bandwidth
p4830: Function generator time slice clock cycle

Reaction: OFF2 (OFF1)
Acknowledge: IMMEDIATELY
Cause: After the line contactor closes the power unit does not signal the READY state within the monitoring time (p0857).
The end of the DC link pre-charging was not able to be completed for one of the following reasons:
1) There is no line supply voltage connected.
2) The line contactor/line side switch has not been closed.
3) The line supply voltage is too low.
4) Line supply voltage incorrectly set (p0210).
5) The pre-charging resistors are overheated as there were too many pre-charging operations per time unit.
6) The pre-charging resistors are overheated as the DC link capacitance is too high.
7) The pre-charging resistors are overheated because when there is no "ready for operation" (r0863.0) of the infeed unit,
power is taken from the DC link.

Remedy: In general:
- check the line supply voltage at the connecting terminals.
- check the line supply voltage setting (p0210).
- check the monitoring time and, if required, increase (p0857).
- where relevant, observe additional power unit messages/signals (e.g. F30027).
- the following applies to booksize units: Wait (approx. 8 min.) until the pre-charging resistors have cooled down. For this
purpose, preferably disconnect the infeed unit from the line supply.
Re 5):
- carefully observe the permissible pre-charging frequency (refer to the appropriate Equipment Manual).
Re 6):
- check the total capacitance of the DC link and reduce in accordance with the maximum permissible DC-link capacitance
if necessary (refer to the appropriate Equipment Manual)
Re 7):
- interconnect the ready-for-operation signal from the infeed unit (r0863.0) in the enable logic of the drives connected to
this DC link
Re 8):
- check the connections of the external line contactor. The line contactor must be open during DC-link fast discharge.
Re 9):
- check the DC link for ground faults or short circuits.

SINAMICS alarms
Alarms
Diagnostics Manual, 01/2015, 6FC5398-6BP40-5BA2 895
Cause: Failure overvoltage in one or several line supply phases.
The fault can be output in two operating states:
1. During the power-on phase of the infeed unit.
The measured line supply angle deviates from the regular characteristic for a 3-phase system - the PLL cannot be
synchronized.
The fault occurs immediately after power-up if, when operating with a Voltage Sensing Module (VSM), the phase
assignment L1, L2, L3 at the VSM differs from the phase assignment at the power unit.
2. While the infeed is operational.
After a voltage dip has been detected or an overvoltage (note A06205) in one or several line phases a fault occurred within
100 ms (also refer to other relevant messages). Generally, before fault message F06200 is output, Alarm A06205 occurs
at least once, whose warning value can provide information regarding the cause of the line supply fault.
Possible causes:
- voltage dip on the line side or phase failure or overvoltage lasting longer than 10 ms.
- overload condition on the load side with peak current.
- line reactor missing.
Remedy: - check the line supply and fuses.
- check the connection and size (rating) of the line reactor.
- check and correct the phase assignment at the VSM (X521 or X522) and at the power unit.
- check the load.
- if failed in operation, carefully note the previous alarm messages A6205 with alarm values.

Message value: %1
Drive object: A_INF, A_INF_840, R_INF, S_INF, S_INF_840
Reaction: NONE
Acknowledge: NONE
Cause: A change in the line filter capacitance was detected in at least one line phase.
The voltages and phase currents of the line filter, measured using a Voltage Sensing Module (VSM), indicate a deviation
of the filter capacitances from the value parameterized in p0221.
A change or a defect of the line filter capacitors results in a shift of the resonant frequencies and can result in severe
damage to the drive system.
Alarm value (r2124, floating point):
The calculated present capacitance in µF (rounded-off to an integer number).
The 1st decimal point specifies the number of the phase (1, 2, 3) where the capacitance deviates from the specified value.
Remedy: - check the parameterized value of the filter capacitance (p0221).
- check the correct wiring of the Voltage Sensing Module (VSM):
Differential voltages u12 and u23 must be present at the 100 V/690 V inputs of the VSM; the phase currents of the line
filter must be connected to the 10 V inputs through a current - voltage converter.
- check the alarm limits for the permissible filter capacitance deviation (p3676).
- check the scaling of the line supply voltage measurement using the VSM (p3660).
- check the scaling of the filter current measurement using the VSM (p3670).
- check the line filter capacitors and if required, replace the line filter.

1. During the power-on phase of the infeed unit.
Consequence:
Synchronization of the infeed to the line supply is interrupted and is restarted.
2. While the infeed is operational.
Consequence:
The infeed remains in the operating (run) state and alarm A6350 is output. This signifies a critical operational fault.
Alarm value (r2124, floating point):
Actual line frequency determined.
See also: p0284 (Line supply frequency exceeded alarm threshold)
Remedy: - check the parameterized line frequency and if required change (p0211).
- check the alarm threshold (p0284).
- check the line supply.
- check the line supply quality.

Message value: -
Drive object: A_INF, A_INF_840, R_INF, S_INF, S_INF_840
Reaction: OFF2 (OFF1)
Acknowledge: IMMEDIATELY (POWER ON)
Cause: The line synchronization is not possible within the monitoring time.
The infeed was re-synchronized to the line supply because it was interrupted due to a line frequency that was determined
to be either too low or too high.
After 20 attempts, synchronization - and therefore also the power-on operation - were interrupted.
Remedy: - check the parameterized line frequency and if required change (p0211).
- check the setting of the threshold values (p0284, p0285).
- check the line supply.
- check the connecting terminals
When using a voltage sensing module (VSM):
- check the line supply connection at the terminals (X521, X522).
- check VSM activation (p0145, p3400).
- check the line supply quality.
Note:
In the case of chassis power units, the availability of correct VSM voltage measured values is imperative for line
synchronization.

Cause: Defective current measurement or a DC current is present during the offset measurement.
Alarm value (r2124, interpret decimal):
1: Excessively high phase current has occurred during the current offset calibration.
2: The measured current offset is greater than the 3% of the maximum permissible converter current (e.g. due to a ground
fault in the DC link).
Remedy: Re alarm value = 1:
- possible counter-measure if there is no line contactor: Power up an adequately long time before OFF1 = 1.
Re alarm value = 2:
- defective current measurement or a DC current is present during the offset measurement.
- check the DC link for a ground fault.

closing the line contactor. The current offset is set to 0.
See also: p3491 (Infeed I-offset measurement monitoring time)
Remedy: - check the DC link for a ground fault. A ground fault can destroy parts and components!
- Check the monitoring time setting and if required increase (p3491). At least 100 ms is required for a valid measurement
(p3491 > 100 ms).

Cause: A changeover of units was initiated. This resulted in a violation of a parameter limit
Possible causes for the violation of a parameter limit:
- When rounding off a parameter corresponding to its decimal places, the steady-state minimum limit or maximum limit
was violated.
- inaccuracies for the data type "FloatingPoint".
In these cases, when the minimum limit is violated then the parameter value is rounded up and when the maximum limited
is violated the parameter value is rounded down.

Cause: A function of the function module "extended torque control" (r0108.1) was activated - however the (complete) function is
not available.
Fault value (r0949, interpret decimal):
1 ... 3: The kT estimator is active (p1780.3 = 1) without a functioning compensation of the voltage emulation error in the
drive converter. This means that the accuracy is severely restricted.
1: The drive converter voltage emulation error "final value" is 0 (p1952).
2: The drive converter voltage emulation error "current offset" is 0 (p1953).
3: The compensation of the voltage emulation error is disabled (p1780.8 = 0).
4: The kT estimator (p1780.3 = 1), the kT(iq) characteristic (p1780.9 = 1) or the compensation of the voltage emulation
error (p1780.8 = 1) was activated without activating the function module "extended torque control" (when the function
module is activated, the following must apply: r0108.1 = 1).
Remedy: Re fault value = 1, 2:
- carry out an identification of the voltage emulation error in the drive converter (p1909.14 = 1, p1910 = 1).
- set the parameter to compensate the voltage emulation error in the drive converter (p1952, p1953).

Re fault cause = 2:
Use an encoder with absolute information (absolute track, unique zero mark, resolver with one pole pair). The function
cannot be tested as long as the encoder is not reset after learning (encoder fault, parking, POWER ON). Continuous use
is not recommended.

Cause: The DC link voltage controller has been activated because of the upper switch-in threshold (p1244).
A system deviation can occur between the setpoint and actual speed.
See also: r0056, p1240
Remedy: Not necessary.
This alarm automatically disappears after the upper threshold has been distinctly undershot.
Otherwise, apply the following measures:
- use a Braking Module or regenerative feedback unit.
- increase the ramp-down times (p1121, p1135).
- shut down the Vdc_max controller (p1240 = 0).
207400 <location>Drive: DC link voltage maximum controller active
Message value: -
Drive object: VECTOR, VECTOR_AC
Reaction: NONE
Acknowledge: NONE
Cause: The DC link voltage controller has been activated because the upper switch-in threshold has been exceeded (r1242, r1282).
The ramp-down times are automatically increased in order to maintain the DC link voltage (r0070) within the permissible
limits. There is a system deviation between the setpoint and actual speeds.
When the DC link voltage controller is switched out (disabled), this is the reason that the ramp-function generator output
is set to the speed actual value.
See also: r0056, p1240, p1280
Remedy: If the controller is not to intervene:
- increase the ramp-down times.
- switch-off the Vdc_max controller (p1240 = 0 for vector control, p1280 = 0 for U/f control).
If the ramp-down times are not to be changed:
- use a chopper or regenerative feedback unit.

Cause: An incorrect commutation angle was detected that can result in a positive coupling in the speed controller.
Possible causes:
- The phase sequence of the output phases for the motor is incorrect (e.g. the phases are interchanged).
- the motor encoder is incorrectly adjusted with respect to the magnet position.
- the motor encoder is damaged.
- the angular commutation offset is incorrectly set (p0431).
- data to calculate the motor model has been incorrectly set (p0356 (motor-stator leakage inductance) and/or p0350 (motorstator resistance) and/or p0352 (cable resistance).
- the changeover speed for the motor model is too low (p1752). The monitoring function only becomes effective above the
changeover speed.
- pole position identification might have calculated an incorrect value when activated (p1982 = 1).
- the motor encoder speed signal is faulted.
- the control loop is instable due to incorrect parameterization.

Remedy: - Check the phase sequence for the motor, and if required, correct (wiring, p1820).
- if the encoder mounting was changed - re-adjust the encoder.
- replace the defective motor encoder.
- correctly set the angular commutation offset (p0431). If required, determine using p1990.
- correctly set the motor stator resistance, cable resistance and motor-stator leakage inductance (p0350, p0352, p0356).
Calculate the cable resistance from the cross-section and length, check the inductance and stator resistance using the
motor data sheet, measure the stator resistance, e.g. using a multimeter - and if required, again identify the values using
the stationary motor data identification (p1910).
- increase the changeover speed for the motor model (p1752). The monitoring is completely de-activated for p1752 >
p1082 (maximum speed).
- with pole position identification activated (p1982 = 1) check the procedure for pole position identification (p1980) and
force a new pole position identification procedure by means of de-selection followed by selection (p1982 = 0 -> 1).

207414 <location>Drive: Encoder serial number changed
Message value: -
Drive object: SERVO, SERVO_840, SERVO_AC
Reaction: ENCODER (NONE, OFF2)
Acknowledge: IMMEDIATELY
Cause: The serial number of the motor encoder of a synchronous motor has changed. The change was only checked for encoders
with serial number (e.g. EnDat encoders) and build-in motors (e.g. p0300 = 401) or third-party motors (p0300 = 2).
Cause 1:
- The encoder was replaced.
Cause 2:
- A third-party, built-in or linear motor was re-commissioned.
Cause 3:
- The motor with integrated and adjusted encoder was replaced.
Cause 4:
- The firmware was updated to a version that checks the encoder serial number.
Note:
With closed-loop position control, the serial number is accepted when starting the adjustment (p2507 = 2).
When the encoder is adjusted (p2507 = 3), the serial number is checked for changes and if required, the adjustment is
reset (p2507 = 1).
Proceed as follows to hide serial number monitoring:
- set the following serial numbers for the corresponding Encoder Data Set: p0441= FF, p0442 = 0, p0443 = 0, p0444 = 0,
p0445 = 0.
- parameterize F07414 as message type N (p2118, p2119).
Remedy: Re causes 1, 2:
Carry out an automatic adjustment using the pole position identification routine. Acknowledge fault. Initiate the pole position
identification routine with p1990 = 1. Then check that the pole position identification routine is correctly executed.
SERVO:
If a pole position identification technique is selected in p1980, and if p0301 does not contain a motor type with an encoder
adjusted in the factory, then p1990 is automatically activated.
or
Set the adjustment via p0431. In this case, the new serial number is automatically accepted.

Remedy: For fault value = 0:
Once the pulse technique has been de-selected automatically (p1750.5 = 0), there are two possible options:
- acknowledge the fault and save parameter p1750.5 = 0 -> field-oriented control mode to standstill is not used and replaced
by transition to open-loop control at low speeds.
- upgrade the power unit firmware (at least V4.3) -> field-oriented control mode to standstill is available.
For fault value = 10:
With active selection of the pulse technique (p1750.5 = 1):
- POWER ON (switch-off/switch-on) the Control Unit and the power unit together again.
or
- carry out a manual warm restart (p0009 = 30, p0976 = 2, 3).
If this does not solve the problem: Replace the power unit component.
For fault value = 20:
- control parameters might have been adjusted (factory setting, commissioning).
- filters must not be connected between motor and converter/inverter.
- check the motor.

SINAMICS alarms
Alarms
938 Diagnostics Manual, 01/2015, 6FC5398-6BP40-5BA2
Remedy: Overvoltage protection can be implemented in the following ways:
1. Limit the maximum speed (p1082) without any additional protection.
The maximum speed without protection is calculated as follows:
Rotary synchronous motors: p1082 [rpm] <= 11.695 * r0297/p0316 [Nm/A]
Linear motors: p1082 [m/min] <= 73.484 * r0297/p0316 [N/A]
Rotary synchronous motor connected to the high-frequency converter:
p1082 [rpm] <= 4.33165E9 * (-p0316 + root(p0316^2 + 4.86E-9 * (r0297 * r0313)^2 * (r0377 - p0233) [mH] * p0234 [µF]) /
(r0297 * r0313^2 * (r0377 - p0233) [mH] * p0234 [µF])
Linear motor connected to the high-frequency converter:
p1082 [m/min] <= 689.403 * p0315 * (root(p0316^2 * p0315^2 + 0.191865 * r0297^2 * (r0377 - p0233) [mH] * p0234 [µF]) /
(r0297 * (r0377 - p0233) [mH] * p0234 [µF])
Rotary induction motor connected to the high-frequency converter:
p1082 [rpm] <= maximum (2.11383E5 / (r0313 * root((r0377 [mH] + r0382 [mH]) * p0234 [µF])) ; 0.6364 * r0297 *
p0311[rpm] / p0304)
2. Use a Voltage Protection Module (VPM) in conjunction with the function "Safe Torque Off" (p9601, p9801 – only for
synchronous motors).
When using a synchronous motor with VPM at the high-frequency converter, the following must apply:
p1082 [rpm] <= p0348 * (r0377 + p0233) / p0233
When a fault condition exists, the VPM short-circuits the motors. During the short-circuit, the pulses must be suppressed
- this means that the terminals for the function "Safe Torque Off" (STO) must be connected to the VPM.
When using a VPM, p0643 must be set to 1.
3. Activate the internal voltage protection (p1231 = 3, only for synchronous motors).
In so doing, the following hardware preconditions must be fulfilled:
- The infeed of the group must be capable of energy recovery (Active Line Module, Smart Line Module), and the energy
recovery power of the infeed must not be less than the maximum utilized S1 power of the synchronous motor.
- For Control Unit and infeed, a 24 V power supply other than that for the Motor Module must be used with the voltage
protection activated. The 24 V power supply of this Motor Module must be DC link buffered (e.g. CSM).
- A Braking Module with a correspondingly configured braking resistor must be available at the DC link.
- The synchronous motor must be short-circuit proof.

Message value: %1

Reaction: NONE (OFF1, OFF2, OFF3)
Acknowledge: IMMEDIATELY
Cause: The changeover to closed-loop control with encoder is not possible as the encoder has not been unparked.
Remedy: - check whether the encoder firmware supports the "parking" function (r0481.6 = 1).
- upgrade the firmware.
Note:
For long-stator motors (p3870.0 = 1), the following applies:
The encoder must have completed the unparking procedure (r3875.0 = 1) before a changeover can be made to closedloop control with encoder. The encoder is unparked using binector input p3876 = 0/1 signal and remains until a 0 signal
in this state.

Diagnostics Manual, 01/2015, 6FC5398-6BP40-5BA2 939
Cause: A drive data set was selected - with the pulses enabled - which has a different parameterized direction of rotation (p1821).
It is only possible to change the motor direction of rotation using p1821 when the pulses are inhibited.
Remedy: - change over the drive data set with the pulses inhibited.
- ensure that the changeover to a drive data set does not result in the motor direction of rotation being changed (i.e. for
these drive data sets, the same value must be in p1821).

- blocksize power unit was used.
2:
The function "Current controller dynamics higher" (p1810.11 = 1) is selected, however is not supported by the safety

3:
The function "DC link voltage compensation in the power unit" (p1810.1 = 1) is selected, however is not supported by the
power unit (r0192.28 = 0).
Remedy: For fault value = 1:
- If necessary, upgrade the firmware of the booksize power unit to a later version (version >= 4.4).
Note:
If the firmware has already been automatically upgraded, then only a POWER ON (switch-off/switch-on) is required.
- Use a booksize power unit (version >= 4.4).
For fault value = 2:
- If an encoder with Safety position actual values sensing is available (r0458[0...2].19 = 1), reparameterize the encoderless
safety technology (p9506 = 1, 3) to safety technology with encoder (p9506 = 0).
Re fault value = 1, 2:
- Deselect the function "Current controller dynamics higher" (p1810.11 = 0) and if required, set the current, speed and
position controller again or calculate (p0340 = 4).
For fault value = 3:
- If necessary, upgrade the firmware of the blocksize power unit to a later version (version >= 4.6).

Reaction: OFF1 (OFF2, OFF3)
Acknowledge: IMMEDIATELY
Cause: The ratio between the multiturn resolution and the modulo range (p2576) is not an integer number.
This results in the adjustment being set back, as the position actual value cannot be reproduced after power-off/power-on.
Remedy: Make the ration between the multiturn resolution and the modulo range an integer number.
The ratio v is calculated as follows:
1. Motor encoder without position tracking
v = (p0421 * p2506 * p0433 * p2505) / (p0432 * p2504 * p2576)
2. Motor encoder with position tracking for the measuring gear
v = (p0412 * p2506 * p2505) / (p2504 * p2576)
3. Motor encoder with position tracking for the load gear
v = (p2721 * p2506 * p0433) / (p0432 * p2576)
4. Motor encoder with position tracking for the load and measuring gear
v = (p2721 * p2506) / p2576
5. Direct encoder without position tracking
v = (p0421 * p2506 * p0433) / (p0432 * p2576)
6. Direct encoder with position tracking for the measuring gear
v = (p0412 * p2506) / p2576

Cause: For a configured linear axis/no modulo axis, the currently effective motor encoder (encoder 1) has exceeded the maximum
possible traversing range.
For the configured linear axis, the maximum traversing range is defined to be 64x (+/- 32x) of p0421. It should be read in
p2721 and interpreted as the number of load revolutions.
Note:
Only the motor encoder in the currently effective drive data set is monitored here. The actual effective drive data set is
displayed in x = r0051 and the corresponding motor encoder is specified in in p0187[x].
Remedy: The fault should be resolved as follows:
- select encoder commissioning (p0010 = 4).
- reset position tracking, position (p2720.2 = 1).
- de-select encoder commissioning (p0010 = 0).
The fault should then be acknowledged and the absolute encoder adjusted.

207449 <location>Load gear: Position tracking actual position outside tolerance window
Message value: %1
Drive object: A_INF, A_INF_840, B_INF, B_INF_840, ENC, ENC_840, HLA, HLA_840, R_INF, S_INF, S_INF_840, SERVO,

Reaction: Infeed: NONE
Servo: OFF1 (NONE, OFF2, OFF3)
Vector: OFF1 (NONE, OFF2, OFF3)
Hla: OFF1 (NONE, OFF2, OFF3)
Acknowledge: IMMEDIATELY
Cause: When powered down, the currently effective motor encoder was moved through a distance greater than was parameterized
in the tolerance window. It is possible that there is no longer any reference between the mechanical system and encoder.
Note:
Only the motor encoder in the currently effective drive data set is monitored here. The actual effective drive data set is
displayed in x = r0051 and the corresponding motor encoder is specified in in p0187[x].
Fault value (r0949, interpret decimal):
Deviation (difference) to the last encoder position in increments of the absolute value after the measuring gear - if one is
being used. The sign designates the traversing direction.
Note:
The deviation (difference) found is also displayed in r2724.
See also: p2722 (Load gear position tracking tolerance window), r2724 (Load gear position difference)
Remedy: Reset the position tracking as follows:
- select encoder commissioning (p0010 = 4).
- reset position tracking, position (p2720.2 = 1).
- de-select encoder commissioning (p0010 = 0).
The fault should then be acknowledged and, if necessary, the absolute encoder adjusted (p2507).

207454 <location>LR: Position actual value preprocessing does not have a valid encoder
Message value: -
Drive object: SERVO, SERVO_840, SERVO_AC, VECTOR, VECTOR_AC
Reaction: NONE
Acknowledge: NONE
Cause: One of the following problems has occurred with the position actual value preprocessing:
- an encoder is not assigned for the position actual value preprocessing (p2502 = 0).
- an encoder is assigned, but no encoder data set (p0187 = 99 or p0188 = 99 or p0189 = 99).
- an encoder an an encoder data set have been assigned, however, the encoder data set does not contain any encoder
data (p0400 = 0) or invalid data (e.g. p0408 = 0).
Remedy: Check the drive data sets, encoder data sets and encoder assignment.

944 Diagnostics Manual, 01/2015, 6FC5398-6BP40-5BA2
Cause: The maximum velocity (p2571) is too high to correctly calculate the modulo correction.
Within the sampling time for positioning (p0115[5]), with the maximum velocity, a maximum of the half modulo length must
be moved through. p2571 was limited to this value.
Remedy: - reduce the maximum velocity (p2571).
- increase the sampling time for positioning (p0115[5]).
207456 <location>EPOS: Setpoint velocity limited
Message value: -

- p0407 * p2503 / (2^p0418*10^7) < 1
- p0407 * p2503 / (2^p0419*10^7) < 1
Remedy: If required, reduce the traversing range or position resolution (p2506).
Increase the fine resolution of absolute position actual value (p0419).
Note for fault value = 3:
If the value for the maximum possible absolute position (LU) is greater than 4294967296, then it is not possible to make
an adjustment due to an overflow.
For rotary encoders, the maximum possible absolute position (LU) is calculated as follows:
1. Motor encoder without position tracking
p2506 * p0433 * p2505 / (p0432 * p2504)
p2506 * p0433 * p2505 * p0421 / (p0432 * p2504) for multiturn encoders
2. Motor encoder with position tracking for measuring gear:
p2506 * p0412 * p2505 / p2504
3. Motor encoder with position tracking for load gear
p2506 * p2721 * p0433 / p0432
4. Motor encoder with position tracking for load and measuring gear
p2506 * p2721
5. Direct encoder without position tracking
p2506 * p0433 / p0432
p2506 * p0433 * p0421 / p0432 for multiturn encoders
6. Direct encoder with position tracking for measuring gear
p2506 * p0412

6:
The input terminal for the measuring probe is not set.
4098:
Error when initializing the measuring probe.
4100:
The measuring pulse frequency is too high.
> 50000:
The measuring clock cycle is not a multiple integer of the position controller clock cycle.
Remedy: De-activate the measuring probe evaluation (BI: p2509 = 0 signal).
Re alarm value = 6:
Set the input terminal for the measuring probe (p0488, p0489 or p2517, p2518).
Re alarm value = 4098:
Check the Control Unit hardware.
Re alarm value = 4100:
Reduce the frequency of the measuring pulses at the measuring probe.
Re alarm value > 50000:
Set the clock cycle ratio of the measuring clock cycle to the position controller clock cycle to an integer multiple.
To do this, the currently effective measuring clock cycle can be determined from the alarm value as follows:
Tmeas [125 µs] = alarm value - 50000
With PROFIBUS, the measuring clock cycle corresponds to the PROFIBUS clock cycle (r2064[1]).
Without PROFIBUS, the measuring clock cycle is an internal cycle time that cannot be influenced.

field weakening (r0063 < p0348).
See also: r0063, p0348
Remedy: Reduce the speed to below the speed at the start of field weakening (r0063 < p0348).

dd = fault cause
dd = 00 hex = 0 dec
An absolute encoder is not being used.
dd = 01 hex = 1 dec
Position tracking cannot be activated because the memory of the internal NVRAM is not sufficient or a Control Unit does
not have an NVRAM.

For a linear axis, the position tracking was activated for the load and measuring gear.
dd = 03 hex = 3 dec
Position tracking cannot be activated because position tracking with another gear ratio, axis type or tolerance window has
already been detected for this encoder data set.
dd = 04 hex = 4 dec

position (r0094) is not plausible (negative or higher than the stroke in p0313).
Remedy: - check position inversion (p0410.1).
- check direction convention: piston position (r0094) must be zero, if the piston is located at the A side. When moving from
the A to the B side, velocity and position increase must be positive.
- check the piston calibration, and if required, recalibrate the piston with the piston at the A side (p1909.1 = 1).
- when replacing the encoder, recalibrate the piston.
- when shifting the machine zero point, recalibrate the piston.
Note:
Before acknowledging the fault, set p0476 = 0. Then calibrate the piston again (p1909.1 = 1 with the piston completely

- current controller not correctly set.
- U/f operation: Up ramp was set too short or the load is too high.
- U/f operation: Short-circuit in the motor cable or ground fault.
- U/f operation: Motor current does not match current of power unit.
- Switch to rotating motor without flying restart function (p1200).
Note:
Limit current = 2 x minimum (p0640, 4 x p0305 x p0306) >= 2 x p0305 x p0306
Remedy: - check the current limits (p0640).
- vector control: Check the current controller (p1715, p1717).
- U/f control: Check the current limiting controller (p1340 ... p1346).
- increase the up ramp (p1120) or reduce the load.
- check the motor and motor cables for short-circuit and ground fault.
- check the motor for the star-delta configuration and rating plate parameterization.
- check the power unit and motor combination.
- Choose "flying restart" function (p1200) if switched to rotating motor.

Cause: The code number of the actual power unit does not match the saved number. This only occurs if the comparator in p9906
or p9908 is not at 2 (low) or 3 (minimum).
Fault value (r0949, interpret decimal):
Number of the incorrect parameter.
See also: r0200, p0201
Remedy: Connect the original power unit and power up the Control Unit again (POWER ON) or set p0201 to r0200 and exit
commissioning with p0010 = 0.
For infeeds, the following applies:
Line reactors or line filters must be used that are specified for the new power unit. A line supply and DC link identification
routine (p3410 = 5) must then be carried out. It is not possible to change the power unit without re-commissioning the
system if the type of infeed (A_Infeed, B_Infeed, S_Infeed), the type of construction/design (booksize, chassis) or the
voltage class differ between the old and new power units.
For inverters, the following applies:
If the new power unit is accepted, then if required, the current limit (p0640) can be reduced by a lower maximum current
of the power unit (r0209) (torque limits stay the same).
If not only the power unit is changed, but also the motor, then the motor must be re-commissioned (e.g. using p0010 = 1).
This is also necessary if motor data is still to be downloaded via DRIVE-CLiQ.

This situation can only occur, if the following conditions apply:
p1300 = 20
p2177 > p1758
p1750.2 = 0
p1750.6 = 0
Remedy: - Deactivate the changeover into open-loop speed controlled operation when operating at the torque limit (p1750.6 = 0).
Condition:
No slow reversing through the open-loop speed controlled operating range p1755 within the time p1758 when operating
at the torque limit.
- shorten the stall detection wait time (p2177 < p1758).
- Activate closed-loop controlled operation from standstill and higher (p1750.2 = 1).
Condition:
There is no active load, for example, a hoisting gear

Cause: The system has identified that the motor has stalled for a time longer than is set in p2178.
Fault value (r0949, interpret decimal):
1: Stall detection using r1408.11 (p1744, p0492).
2: Stall detection using r1408.12 (p1745) or via the flux difference (r0083 ... r0084).
3: Stall detection using r0056.11 (only for separately excited synchronous motors).
See also: p1744, p2178
Remedy: For closed-loop speed and torque control with speed encoder, the following applies:
- check the speed signal (interrupted cable, polarity, pulse number, broken encoder shaft).
- check the speed encoder, if another speed encoder was selected using the data set changeover. This must be connected
to the same motor that is controlled for the data set changeover.
If there is no fault, then the fault tolerance (p1744 and p0492) can be increased.
For closed-loop speed and torque control without speed encoder, the following applies:
- check whether the drive in the open-loop controlled mode (r1750.0) stalls under load. If yes, then increase the current
setpoint using p1610.
- check whether the drive stalls due to the load if the speed setpoint is still zero. If yes, then increase the current setpoint
using p1610.
- if the motor excitation (magnetizing) time (r0346) was significantly reduced, then it should be increased again.
- check the current limits (p0640, r0067). If the current limits are too low, then the drive cannot be magnetized.
- check the current controller (p1715, p1717) and the speed adaptation controller (p1764, p1767). If the dynamic response
was significantly reduced, then this should be increased again.
- check the speed encoder, if another speed encoder was selected using the data set changeover. This must be connected
to the motor that is controlled for the data set changeover.
If there is no fault, then the fault tolerance (p1745) or the delay time (p2178) can be increased.
For separately-excited synchronous motors (closed-loop control with speed encoder), the following applies:
- check the speed signal (interrupted cable, polarity, pulse number).
- ensure the correct motor parameterization (rating plate and equivalent circuit diagram parameters).
- check the excitation equipment and the interface to the closed-loop control.
- encoder the highest possible dynamic response of the closed-loop excitation current control.
- check the speed control for any tendency to oscillate and if resonance effects occur, use a bandstop filter.
- do not exceed the maximum speed (p2162).
If there is no fault, then the delay time can be increased (p2178).

Message value: %1

Cause: The system has identified that the motor has stalled for a time longer than is set in p2178.
Fault value (r0949, interpret decimal):
1: Stall detection using r1408.11 (p1744, p0492).
2: Stall detection using r1408.12 (p1745) or via the flux difference (r0083 ... r0084).

990 Diagnostics Manual, 01/2015, 6FC5398-6BP40-5BA2
Remedy: It should always be carefully ensured that the motor data identification (p1910) as well as the rotating measurement (p1960)
were carried out (also refer to r3925). For synchronous motors with encoder, the encoder must have been adjusted (p1990).
For closed-loop speed and torque control with speed encoder, the following applies:
- check the speed signal (interrupted cable, polarity, pulse number, broken encoder shaft).
- check the speed encoder, if another speed encoder was selected using the data set changeover. This must be connected
to the same motor that is controlled for the data set changeover.
If there is no fault, then the fault tolerance (p1744 or p0492) can be increased. For resolvers with a high signal ripple, for
example p0492 should be increased and the speed signal smoothed (p1441, p1442).
If the stalled motor should take place in the range of the monitor model and for speeds of less than 30 % of the rated motor
speed, then a change can be made directly from the current model into the flux impression (p1401.5 = 1). We therefore
recommend that the time-controlled model change is switched in (p1750.4 = 1) or the model changeover limits are
significantly increased (p1752 > 0.35 x p0311; p1753 = 5 %).
- check the speed encoder, if another speed encoder was selected using the data set changeover. This must be connected
to the motor that is controlled for the data set changeover.
For closed-loop speed and torque control without speed encoder, the following applies:
- Check whether the drive stalls solely due to the load in controlled mode (r1750.0) or when the speed setpoint is still zero.
If so, increase the current setpoint via p1610 or set p1750.2 = 1 (sensorless vector control to standstill for passive loads).
- If the motor excitation time (p0346) was significantly reduced and the drive stalls when it is switched on and run
immediately, p0346 should be increased again or quick magnetizing selected (p1401).
- check the current controller (p1715, p1717) and the speed adaptation controller (p1764, p1767). If the dynamic response
was significantly reduced, then this should be increased again.
- If there is no fault, then the fault tolerance (p1745) or the delay time (p2178) can be increased.
The following generally apply for closed-loop and torque control:
- Check whether the motor cables are disconnected.
- check the current limits (p0640, r0067, r0289). If the current limits are too low, then the drive cannot be magnetized.
- If the fault occurs with fault value 2 when the motor accelerates very quickly to the field weakening range, the deviation
between the flux setpoint and flux actual value can be reduced and, in turn, the message prevented, by reducing p1596
or p1553.
For separately-excited synchronous motors (closed-loop control with speed encoder), the following applies:
- check the speed signal (interrupted cable, polarity, pulse number).
- ensure the correct motor parameterization (rating plate and equivalent circuit diagram parameters).
- check the excitation equipment and the interface to the closed-loop control.
- encoder the highest possible dynamic response of the closed-loop excitation current control.
- check the speed control for any tendency to oscillate and if resonance effects occur, use a bandstop filter.
- do not exceed the maximum speed (p2162).
If there is no fault, then the delay time can be increased (p2178).
207903 <location>Drive: Motor speed deviation
Message value: -
Drive object: SERVO, SERVO_840, SERVO_AC, VECTOR, VECTOR_AC
Reaction: NONE
Acknowledge: NONE
Cause: The absolute value of the speed difference from the two setpoints (p2151, p2154) and the speed actual value (r2169)
exceeds the tolerance threshold (p2163) longer than tolerated (p2164, p2166).
The alarm is only enabled for p2149.0 = 1.
Possible causes could be:
- the load torque is greater than the torque setpoint.
- when accelerating, the torque/current/power limit is reached. If the limits are not sufficient, then it is possible that the
drive has been dimensioned too small.
- for closed-loop torque control, the speed setpoint does not track the speed actual value.
- for active Vdc controller.
For U/f control, the overload condition is detected as the Imax controller is active.

Cause: The armature short-circuit is incorrectly parameterized.
Fault value (r0949, interpret decimal):
zzzzyyxx: zzzz = fault cause, xx = motor data set
zzzz = 0001 hex = 1 dec:
A permanent-magnet synchronous motor has not been selected.
zzzz = 0002 hex = 2 dec:
No induction motor selected.
zzzz = 0065 hex = 101 dec:
External armature short-circuit: Output (r1239.0) not wired.
zzzz = 0066 hex = 102 dec:
External armature short-circuit with contactor feedback signal: No feedback signal connected (BI:p1235). The feedback

zzzz = 00C9 hex = 201 dec:
Internal voltage protection: The maximum output current of the Motor Module (r0209) is less than 1.8 x motor short-circuit
current (r0331).
zzzz = 00CA hex = 202 dec:
Internal voltage protection: A Motor Module in booksize or chassis format is not being used.
zzzz = 00CB hex = 203 dec:
Internal voltage protection: The motor short-circuit current (p0320) is greater than the maximum motor current (p0323).
zzzz = 00CC hex = 204 dec:
Internal voltage protection: The activation (p1231 = 4) is not given for all motor data sets with synchronous motors (p0300
= 2xx, 4xx).
Remedy: For fault value = 1:
- an armature short-circuit / voltage protection is only permissible for permanent-magnetic synchronous motors. The highest
position of the motor type in p0300 must either be 2 or 4.
For fault value = 101:
- the contactor for the external armature short-circuit configuration should be controlled using output signal r1239.0. For
instance, the signal can be connected to an output terminal via binector input p0738. Before this fault can be acknowledged,
p1231 must be set again.
For fault value = 102:
- if the external armature short-circuit with contactor feedback signal (p1231 = 1) is selected, this feedback signal must be
connected to an input terminal (e.g. r722.x) and then connected to BI: p1235.
- alternatively, the external armature short-circuit without contactor feedback signal (p1231 = 2) can be selected.
For fault value = 103:
- if the external armature short-circuit without contactor feedback signal (p1231 = 2) is selected, then a delay time must
be parameterized in p1237. This time must always be greater than the actual contactor opening time, as otherwise the
Motor Module would be short-circuited!
For fault value = 201:
- a Motor Module with a higher maximum current or a motor with a lower short-circuit current must be used. The maximum
Motor Module current must be higher than 1.8 x short-circuit current of the motor.
For fault value = 202:
- for internal voltage protection, use a Motor Module in booksize or chassis format.
For fault value = 203:
- for internal voltage protection, only use short-circuit proof motors.
For fault value = 204:
- The internal voltage protection must either be activated for all motor data sets with synchronous motors (p0300 = 2xx,
4xx) (p1231 = 3) or it must be de-activated for all motor data sets (p1231 not equal to 3). This therefore ensures that the
protection cannot be accidentally withdrawn as a result of a data set changeover. The fault can only be acknowledged if
this condition is fulfilled.

suppression
Message value: -
Drive object: SERVO, SERVO_840, SERVO_AC, VECTOR, VECTOR_AC
Reaction: NONE
Acknowledge: IMMEDIATELY
Cause: The function "Internal voltage protection" (p1231 = 3) was activated.
The following must be observed:
- when the internal voltage protection is active, after pulse suppression, all of the motor terminals are at half of the DC link
voltage (without an internal voltage protection, the motor terminals are at zero potential)!
- it is only permissible to use motors that are short-circuit proof (p0320 < p0323).
- the Motor Module must be able to continually conduct 180% short-circuit current (r0331) of the motor (r0289).
- the internal voltage protection cannot be interrupted due to a fault response. If an overcurrent condition occurs during
the active, internal voltage protection, then this can destroy the Motor Module and/or the motor.
- if the Motor Module does not support the autonomous, internal voltage protection (r0192.10 = 0), in order to ensure safe,
reliable functioning when the line supply fails, an external 24 V power supply (UPS) must be used for the components.
- if the Motor Module does support the autonomous, internal voltage protection (r0192.10 = 1), in order to ensure safe,
reliable functioning when the line supply fails, the 24 V power supply for the components must be provided through a
Control Supply Module.
- if the internal voltage protection is active, it is not permissible that the motor is driven by the load for a longer period of
time (e.g. as a result of loads that move the motor or another coupled motor).

Cause: The Motor Module signals that the motor is short-circuited through the power semiconductors (r1239.5 = 1). The pulses
cannot be enabled. The internal voltage protection is selected (p1231 = 3).
Remedy: If the Motor Module supports the autonomous internal voltage protection (r0192.10 = 1), then the Motor Module
automatically decides - using the DC link voltage - as to whether the armature short-circuit should be activated.
The armature short-circuit is activated and response OFF2 is initiated if the DC link voltage exceeds 800 V. If the DC link
voltage falls below 450 V, then the armature short-circuit is withdrawn.
If the motor is still in a critical speed range, the armature short-circuit is re-activated once the DC link voltage exceeds the
threshold of 800 V.
If the autonomous (independent) internal voltage protection is active (r1239.5 = 1) and the line supply returns (450 V <
DC link voltage < 800 V), the armature short-circuit is withdrawn after 3 minutes.

Message value: -
Drive object: SERVO, SERVO_840, SERVO_AC, VECTOR, VECTOR_AC
Reaction: NONE
Acknowledge: NONE
Cause: This alarm is output for r1229.5 = 1.
For r1229.5 = 1, OFF1/OFF3 are suppressed to prevent the drive accelerating by a load that drives the motor - whereby
OFF2 remains effective.
See also: p1217 (Motor holding brake closing time), r1229 (Motor holding brake status word)
Remedy: - check the functionality of the motor holding brake.
- check the feedback signal (p1222).
207934 <location>Drive: S120 Combi motor holding brake configuration
Message value: %1
Drive object: HLA, HLA_840, SERVO, SERVO_840, SERVO_AC, VECTOR, VECTOR_AC
Reaction: NONE (OFF1, OFF2, OFF3)
Acknowledge: IMMEDIATELY (POWER ON)
Cause: A connected motor holding brake has been detected with an S120 Combi. However, this brake has not been assigned to
just one Combi feed drive and, therefore, brake control is not configured (correctly).
Fault value (r0949, interpret decimal):
0: No motor holding brake is assigned (p1215 = 0 or 3 on all S120 Combi feed drives).
1: More than one motor holding brake has been assigned (p1215 = 1 or 2 on more than one S120 Combi feed drive) - or
there is more than one DRIVE-CLiQ motor with motor holding brake.
2: Brake was accidentally assigned to the spindle (p1215 = 1); this is not permitted for this software release.
3: An attempt was made to enable the function "Safe brake control" (SBC, p9602 = p9802 = 1) for the spindle. This is not
permitted for this software release.
Remedy: Check whether the motor holding brake has been assigned to one S120 Combi feed drive exclusively (p1215 = 1 or 2).
The fault will only be withdrawn once the motor holding brake has been assigned to just one of the S120 Combi feed drives
(p1215 = 1 or 2 for this one drive). From this point, the motor holding brake will be controlled by this drive.

1000 Diagnostics Manual, 01/2015, 6FC5398-6BP40-5BA2
Cause: An incorrect motor holding brake configuration was detected.
Fault value (r0949, interpret decimal):
0:
A motor holding brake was detected where the brake control has not been configured (p1215 = 0).
The brake control configuration was set to "motor holding brake the same as sequence control" (p1215 = 1) (only when
commissioning for the first time).
For a chassis unit with Safe Brake Adapter (SBA), the interconnection p9621 = r9872.3 was established (only when
commissioning for the first time).
For a parallel connection, the power unit was set in p7015, to which the motor holding brake is connected (only when
commissioning for the first time).
1:
A motor holding brake was detected where the brake control has not been configured (p1215 = 0).
The brake control configuration was left at "No motor holding brake available" (p1215 = 0).
11:
The identification had detected more than one motor holding brake for a parallel connection.
12:
For the parallel connection, in p0121 there is no valid component number for the power unit data set that is set in p7015.
13:
With the "Safe brake control" (SBC) function activated, an attempt was made to change the value in p7015.
14:
For a parallel connection, the power units set in p7015 cannot be addressed.
Remedy: For fault value = 0:
- No remedy required.
For fault value = 1:
- If required change the motor holding brake configuration (p1215 = 1, 2).
- If this fault value unexpectedly occurs, then the motor connections should be checked in order to rule out that they have
been interchanged.
For fault value = 11:
For a parallel connection, only connect one motor holding brake.
For fault value = 12:
Check the setting of the power unit data set for a parallel connection (p7015).
For fault value = 13:
Before changing p7015, deactivate the "Safe brake control" function (SBC) (p9602).
For fault value = 14:
Check whether the power unit supports the brake control for a parallel connection (r9771.14).
Check whether there is a DRIVE-CLiQ communication error between the Control Unit and the power unit involved and, if
required, carry out a diagnostics routine for the faults identified.

207940 <location>Sync-line-drive: Synchronizing error
Message value: -
Drive object: VECTOR, VECTOR_AC
Reaction: OFF2
Acknowledge: IMMEDIATELY
Cause: After synchronization has been completed, the phase difference (r3808) is greater than the threshold value, phase
synchronism (p3813).
OFF1 or OFF3 response, while the closed-loop phase control is active (r3819.6 = 1) or synchronism reached (r3819.2 =
1).
Enable signal withdrawn (p3802 = 0), while the closed-loop phase control was active (r3819.6 = 1).
Remedy: If required increase the threshold value phase synchronism (p3813) for synchronizing the line supply to the drive.
Before OFF1 or OFF3, complete synchronizing (r03819.0 = 0).
Before withdrawing the enable signal (p3802 = 0), reach synchronism (r3819.2 = 1).

207950 <location>Drive: Incorrect motor parameter
Message value: Parameter: %1
Drive object: SERVO, SERVO_840, SERVO_AC, VECTOR, VECTOR_AC
Reaction: NONE
Acknowledge: IMMEDIATELY
Cause: - the motor parameters were incorrectly entered while commissioning (e.g. p0300 = 0, no motor)
- The braking resistor (p6811) has still not been parameterized - commissioning cannot be completed.
Fault value (r0949, interpret decimal):
Parameter number involved.
300 (CU250S-2):
For this control mode, the motor type is not supported.

Message value: Parameter: %1
Drive object: SERVO, SERVO_840, SERVO_AC, VECTOR, VECTOR_AC
Reaction: NONE
Acknowledge: IMMEDIATELY
Cause: The code number of the actual motor with DRIVE-CLiQ does not match the saved number.
Fault value (r0949, interpret decimal):
Number of the incorrect parameter.
See also: p0301, r0302
Remedy: Connect the original motor, power up the Control Unit again (POWER ON) and exit quick commissioning with p0010 = 0.
Or set p0300 = 10000 (load the parameters from the motor with DRIVE-CLiQ) and re-commission.
Quick commissioning (p0010 = 1) is automatically exited with p3900 > 0.
If quick commissioning was exited with p0010 = 0, then an automatic controller calculation (p0340 = 1) is not carried out.

207960 <location>Drive: Incorrect friction characteristic
Message value: Parameter: %1
Drive object: SERVO, SERVO_840, SERVO_AC, VECTOR, VECTOR_AC
Reaction: NONE
Acknowledge: NONE
Cause: The friction characteristic is incorrect.
Alarm value (r2124, interpret decimal):
1538:
The friction torque is greater than the maximum from the upper effective torque limit (p1538) and zero. This is the reason
that the output of the friction characteristic (r3841) is limited to this value.
1539:
The friction torque is less than the minimum from the lower effective torque limit (p1539) and zero. This is the reason that
the output of the friction characteristic (r3841) is limited to this value.
3820 ... 3829:
Incorrect parameter number. The speeds entered in the parameters for the friction characteristic do not correspond to the
following condition:
0.0 < p3820 < p3821 < ... < p3829 <= p0322 or p1082, if p0322 = 0
Therefore the output of the friction characteristic (r3841) is set to zero.
3830 ... 3839:
Incorrect parameter number. The torques entered in the parameters for the friction characteristic do not correspond to the
following condition:
0 <= p3830, p3831 ... p3839 <= p0333
Therefore the output of the friction characteristic (r3841) is set to zero.
See also: r3840 (Friction characteristic status word)
Remedy: Fulfill the conditions for the friction characteristic.
Re alarm value = 1538:
Check the upper effective torque limit (e.g. in the field weakening range).
Re alarm value = 1539:
Check the lower effective torque limit (e.g. in the field weakening range).
Re alarm value = 3820 ... 3839:
Fulfill the conditions to set the parameters of the friction characteristic.
If the motor data (e.g. the maximum speed p0322) are changed during commissioning (p0010 = 1, 3), then the technological
limits and threshold values, dependent on this, must be re-calculated by selecting p0340= 5).

Message value: -
Drive object: SERVO, SERVO_840, SERVO_AC
Reaction: NONE
Acknowledge: NONE
Cause: The rotating measurement is activated. For the rotating measurement, the motor can accelerate up to the maximum speed
and with maximum torque. Only the parameterized current limit (p0640) and the maximum speed (p1082) are effective.
The behavior of the motor can be influenced using the direction inhibit (p1959.14, p1959.15) and the ramp-up/ramp-down
time (p1958).
The rotating measurement is carried out at the next power-on command.
See also: p1960
Remedy: Not necessary.
The alarm automatically disappears after the rotating measurement has been successfully completed or for the setting
p1960 = 0.
Note:
If a POWER ON or a warm restart is performed with motor data identification selected, the motor data identification request
will be lost. If motor data identification is required, it will need to be selected again manually following ramp-up.

- the measurement was carried out at an operating point where the load torque is too high. Select a more suitable operating
point, either by changing the speed setpoint (p1961) or by reducing the load torque. The load torque may not be varied
while making measurements.

6: No Lq measurement possible because field weakening is active.
7: Speed actual value exceeds the maximum speed p1082 or 75% of the rated motor speed.
8: Speed actual value is below 2 % of the rated motor speed.
Remedy: For fault value = 1:
- check the motor parameters.
- carry out a motor data identification routine (p1910).
- if required, reduce the dynamic factor (p1967 < 25 %).
For fault value = 2:

For fault value = 5:
- flux setpoint p1570 = 100 % and current setpoint p1610 = 0 % kept during the Lq measurement.
For fault value = 6:
- reduce the regenerative load so that the drive does not reach field weakening when accelerating.
- reduce p1965 so that the q leakage inductance is recorded at lower speeds.
For fault value = 7:
- increase p1082 if this is technically permissible.
- reduce p1965 so that the q leakage inductance is recorded at lower speeds.

Cause: A fault has occurred during the identification routine.
Fault value (r0949, interpret decimal):
1: piston calibration without absolute position (p1407.3 = 0).
2: determining the control sense without moving in both directions.
3: determining the control sense without a clear result.
4: determining the valve offset without moving.
5: traversing range identification without absolute position or piston calibration.
6: The measured piston stroke differs from the parameterized piston stroke (p0313) by more than 20 %.
7: For the characteristic measurement, the drive comes to a standstill before reaching the parameterized free distance.
8: The loop gain of the force controller is incorrect. At the positive end stop, pA (r0067) < pB (r0068).
100: Position and speed actual value inversion differ (p0410).
101: Start of measuring range > end of measuring range (p1955[0] > p1955[1]).
102: Minimum measuring travel > maximum measuring travel (p1956[0] > p1956[1]).
190: Velocity setpoint is not zero.
Remedy: For fault value = 1:
- home the drive before calibrating the piston (p1407.3 must be = 1).

For fault value = 6:
- there is an obstruction in the traversing range. If necessary, remove the obstruction. If the measuring travel with obstruction
is sufficient, no measure has to be applied.
- the piston stroke was incorrectly parameterized. If the actual piston stroke is less than the parameterized stroke, correct
it (p0313). A piston stroke that has been parameterized too low, is automatically corrected.
For fault value = 7:
- piston calibration was incorrectly carried out. Correct the piston calibration or automatically calibrate it (p1959.2 = 1 and
p1960 = 1).
- the minimum or maximum parameterized measuring travel cannot be traversed as there is an obstruction in the path or
the piston stroke was incorrectly parameterized. If required, correct the measuring travel (p1956[0], p1956[1]), correct the
piston stroke or automatically calibrate it (p1959.x = 1 and p1960 = 1).
- drive cannot be traversed, because the shutoff valve does not open, the system pressure is not available, encoder or
valve are not connected. Check the shutoff valve, system pressure, encoder and valve connection.
For fault value = 8:
- interchange the connectors of pressure sensors A and B or invert the direction of motion (invert p1820 and p0410 ) and
repeat the complete moving measurement.
- check the reference values for pressure sensors (p0240, p0242).
For fault value = 100:
Set the position and speed actual value inversion the same (p0410 = 0 or p0410 = 3).
For fault value = 101:
Start of measuring range must be parameterized less than the end of measuring range (p1955[0] > p1955[1]).
For fault value = 102:
Minimum measuring travel must be parameterized less than the maximum measuring travel (p1956[0] > p1956[1]).

Cause: A fault has occurred during the identification routine.
Fault value (r0949, interpret decimal):
1: Current limit value reached.
2: Identified stator resistance lies outside the expected range 0.1 ... 100% of Zn.
3: Identified rotor resistance lies outside the expected range 0.1 ... 100% of Zn. Separately excited synchronous motors:
damping resistance outside 1.0 ...15 % of Zn.
4: Identified stator reactance lies outside the expected range 50 ... 900 % of Zn. Separately excited synchronous motors:
stator reactance outside 20 ...500 % of Zn.
5: Identified magnetizing reactance lies outside the expected range 50 ... 900 % of Zn. Separately excited synchronous
motors: magnetizing reactance outside 20 ...500 % of Zn.
6: Identified rotor time constant lies outside the expected range 10 ms ... 5 s. Separately-excited synchronous motors:
damping time constant outside of 5 ms ... 1 s.
7: Identified total leakage reactance lies outside the expected range 4 ... 100 % of Zn.
8: Identified stator leakage reactance lies outside the expected range 2 ... 50% of Zn. Separately excited synchronous
motors: stator leakage reactance outside 2 ...40 % of Zn.
9: Identified rotor leakage reactance lies outside the expected range 2 ... 50% of Zn. Separately excited synchronous
motors: damping leakage reactance outside 1.5 ...20 % of Zn.
10: Motor has been incorrectly connected.
11: Motor shaft rotates.
12: Ground fault detected.
15: Pulse inhibit occurred during motor data identification
20: Identified threshold voltage of the semiconductor devices lies outside the expected range 0 ... 10 V.
30: Current controller in voltage limiting.
40: At least one identification contains errors. The identified parameters are not saved to prevent inconsistencies.
50: The selected sampling time is too low for the motor identification (p0115[0]).
Note:
Percentage values are referred to the rated motor impedance:
Zn = Vmot.nom / sqrt(3) / Imot,nom
Remedy: Re fault value = 1 ... 40:
- check whether motor data have been correctly entered in p0300, p0304 ... p0311.
- is there an appropriate relationship between the motor power rating and that of the Motor Module? The ratio of the Motor
Module to the rated motor current should not be less than 0.5 and not be greater than 4.
- check configuration (star-delta).
Re fault value = 11 in addition:
- Deactivate oscillation monitoring (p1909.7 = 1).
For fault value = 2:
- for parallel circuits, check the motor winding system in p7003. If, for power units connected in parallel, a motor is specified
with a single-winding system (p7003 = 0), although a multi-winding system is being used, then a large proportion of the
stator resistance is interpreted as feeder cable resistance and entered in p0352.
Re fault value = 4, 7:
- check whether inductances are correctly set in p0233 and p0353.
- check whether motor has been correctly connected (star-delta).
- Set p1909.0 = 1.
For fault value = 12:
- check the power cable connections.
- check the motor.
- check the CT.
For fault value = 50:
- Perform a motor data identification with a higher sampling time, and after this, change to the required higher sampling
time (p0115[0]).

1022 Diagnostics Manual, 01/2015, 6FC5398-6BP40-5BA2
Drive object: HLA, HLA_840
Reaction: NONE
Acknowledge: NONE
Cause: Data identification is activated.
Data identification is performed at the next switch-on command. When doing this, the drive moves.
See also: p1910, p1960
Remedy: Not necessary.
The alarm automatically disappears after the data identification routine has been successfully completed or for the setting
p1910 = 0 or p1960 = 0.
If a POWER ON or a warm restart is performed with motor data identification selected, the motor data identification request
will be lost. If motor data identification is required, it will need to be selected again manually following ramp-up.
207991 <location>Drive: Motor data identification activated
Message value: -
Drive object: SERVO, SERVO_840, SERVO_AC
Reaction: NONE
Acknowledge: NONE
Cause: The motor data identification routine is activated.
The motor data identification routine is carried out at the next power-on command.
See also: p1910, p1960
Remedy: Not necessary.
The alarm automatically disappears after the motor data identification routine has been successfully completed or for the
setting p1910 = 0 or p1960 = 0.
If a POWER ON or a warm restart is performed with motor data identification selected, the motor data identification request

207991 <location>Drive: Motor data identification activated
Message value: -
Drive object: VECTOR, VECTOR_AC
Reaction: NONE
Acknowledge: NONE
Cause: The motor data identification routine is activated.
The motor data identification routine is carried out at the next power-on command.
If rotating measurement is selected (see p1900, p1960), it will not be possible to save the parameter assignment. Once
motor data identification has been completed or de-activated, the option to save the parameter assignment will be made
available again.

207993 <location>Drive: Incorrect direction of rotation of the field or encoder actual value inversion
Message value: -
Drive object: SERVO, SERVO_840, SERVO_AC
Reaction: OFF2 (NONE)
Acknowledge: IMMEDIATELY
Cause: Either the direction of the rotating field or the encoder actual value has an incorrect sign. The motor data identification
automatically changed the actual value inversion (p0410) in order to correct the control sense. This can result in a direction
of rotation change.
Note:
To acknowledge this fault, the correctness of the direction of rotation must first be acknowledged with p1910 = -2.

Diagnostics Manual, 01/2015, 6FC5398-6BP40-5BA2 1023
Remedy: Check the direction of rotation (also for the position controller, if one is being used).
If the direction of rotation is correct, the following applies:
No additional measures are required (except set p1910 = -2 and acknowledge fault).
If the direction of rotation is incorrect, the following applies:
To change the direction of rotation, two phases must be interchanged and the motor identification routine must be repeated.
207994 <location>Drive: motor data identification not performed
Message value: -
Drive object: VECTOR, VECTOR_AC
Reaction: NONE
Acknowledge: NONE
Cause: The "vector control" mode has been selected and a motor data identification has still not been performed.
The alarm is initiated when changing the drive data set (see r0051) in the following cases:
- vector control is parameterized in the actual drive data set (p1300 >= 20).
and
- motor data identification has still not been performed in the actual drive data set (see r3925).
Note:
For SINAMICS G120, a check is made and an alarm is output also when exiting commissioning and when the system
powers up.
Remedy: - Perform motor data identification (see p1900).
- If required, parameterize "U/f control" (p1300 < 20).
- switch over to a drive data set, in which the conditions do not apply.

1024 Diagnostics Manual, 01/2015, 6FC5398-6BP40-5BA2
Cause: The pole position identification routine was unsuccessful.
Fault value (r0949, interpret decimal):
1: No current is established.
2: The starting current is not zero.
3: The selected max. distance was exceeded (p1981).
4x: The measuring signal does not permit a clear evaluation.
5: The max. current was exceeded during the measurement.

8: The pole position identification routine current required is greater than the max. current.
9: The set pole position identification routine current is zero.
10: Data set changeover during the pole position identification.
11: The encoder adjustment to determine the commutation angle is active (p1990 = 1) and the encoder without zero mark
is not finely synchronized or does not have any valid data.
100: Motion-based pole position identification, 1st and 2nd measurement different. Motor blocked or current (p1993) too
low.
101: Motion-based position position identification, insufficient motion, motor blocked or current (p1993) too low.
102: Motion-based pole position identification, brake is being used and is closed. The motion-based position position
identification in conjunction with the brake is not permitted.
103: Motion-based pole position identification without encoder.

Remedy: For fault value = 1:
- check the motor connection and DC link voltage.
- for the following parameters, set practical values that are not zero (p0325, p0329).
Re fault value = 1, 2:
- in the case of a large computing time load (e.g., 6 drives with Safety Integrated), set the computing dead time of the
current controller to late transfers (p0117 = 3).
For fault value = 3:
- increase the max. distance (p1981).
- reduce the currents for the pole position identification routine (p0325, p0329).
- stop the motor in order to carry out the pole position identification routine.
For fault value = 5:
- reduce the currents for the pole position identification routine (p0325, p0329).
For fault value = 6:
- re-calibrate the Motor Module.
For fault value = 8:
- reduce the currents for the pole position identification routine (p0329, p0325, p1993).
- the power unit cannot provide the necessary pole position identification routine current (p0209 < p0329, p0325, p1993),
replace the power unit with a power unit with a higher max. current.
For fault value = 9:
- enter a value not equal to zero in the pole position identification routine current (p0329, p0325, p1993).
For fault value = 10:
- do not initiate a data set changeover during the pole position identification.
For fault value = 11:
- for incremental encoders without commutation with zero mark (p0404.15 = 0), it does not make sense to adjust the
encoder to determine the commutation angle (p1990 = 1). In this case, the function should be de-selected (p1990 = 0) or,
for an encoder with suitable zero mark, commutation with zero mark should be selected (p0404.15 = 1).
- for absolute encoders, only adjust the encoder to determine the commutation angle (p1990 = 1) if the encoder supplies
commutation information and is finely synchronized (p1992.8 = 1 and p1992.10 = 1). The encoder is possibly parked, deactivated (p0145), not ready for operation or signals a fault condition.
- de-select the encoder adjustment to determine the commutation angle (set p1990 to 0).
Re fault value = 40 ... 49:
- increase the currents for the pole position identification routine (p0325, p0329).
- stop the motor in order to carry out the pole position identification routine.
- select another technique for pole position identification routine (p1980).
- use another motor, absolute encoder or Hall sensors.
Re fault value = 70 ... 79:
- upgrade the software in the Sensor Module.
Re fault value = 100, 101:
- check and ensure that the motor is free to move.
- increase the current for motion-based pole position identification (p1993).
For fault value = 102:
- if the motor is to be operated with a brake: Select a different technique to identify the pole position (p1980).
- if the motor can be operated without a brake: Open the brake (p1215 = 2).
For fault value = 103:
- the motion-based pole position identification can only be carried out using an encoder. Connect an encoder or select
another technique for pole position identification routine (p1980).
For fault value = 104:
- pole position identification, increase the smoothing time, motion-based (p1997).
- pole position identification, increase the rise time, motion-based (p1994).
- pole position identification, check the gain, motion-based (p1995).
- pole position identification, check the integral time, motion-based (p1996).
- for motor encoders with track A/B sq-wave (p0404.3 = 1) and flank time measurement (p0430.20 = 0), disable the integral
time (p1996 = 0).
For fault value = 200:

207996 <location>Drive: Pole position identification routine not carried out
Message value: -
Drive object: SERVO, SERVO_840, SERVO_AC
Reaction: ENCODER (OFF2)
Acknowledge: IMMEDIATELY
Cause: In operation, the operating mode that requires a pole position identification was changed over, which is not possible in this
state.
- the drive was changed over, flying, from encoderless operation to operation with encoder without having previously carried
out a pole position identification for the encoder. p1404 is then at a value between zero and the max. speed and the pulses
in the speed range above p1404 were enabled without a pole position ident. routine having been previously carried out in
operation with encoder.
- in operation, an EDS changeover was made to an encoder where it is necessary to carry out a pole position identification.
However, this has still not been carried out (p1982 = 1 or 2 and p1992.7 = 0).
Remedy: - for a flying changeover between operation with and without encoder with pole position identification after POWER ON
or commissioning (p0010 not equal to zero) enable the pulses once at zero speed. This means that the pole position
identification routine is carried out and the result is available for operation.
- carry out the EDS changeover with the pulses inhibited, or, before the changeover, carry out a pole position identification
using this data set.

Cause: A CAN communications error has occurred.
Fault value (r0949, interpret decimal):
1: The error counter for the send telegrams has exceeded the BUS OFF value 255. The bus disables the CAN controller.
- bus cable short circuit.
- incorrect baud rate.
- incorrect bit timing.
2: The master no longer interrogated the CAN node status longer than for its "life time". The "life time" is obtained from
the "guard time" (p8604[0]) multiplied by the "life time factor" (p8604[1]).
- bus cable interrupted.
- bus cable not connected.
- incorrect baud rate.
- incorrect bit timing.
- master fault.
Note:
The fault response can be set as required using p8641.
See also: p8604 (CAN life guarding), p8641 (CAN Abort Connection Option Code)
Remedy: - check the bus cable
- check the baud rate (p8622).

Alarms
Diagnostics Manual, 01/2015, 6FC5398-6BP40-5BA2 1043
Cause: The power unit has detected an overcurrent condition.
- closed-loop control is incorrectly parameterized.
- motor has a short-circuit or fault to ground (frame).
- U/f operation: Up ramp set too low.
- U/f operation: Rated motor current is significantly greater than that of the Motor Module.
- infeed: High discharge and post-charging currents for voltage dip.
- infeed: High post-charging currents for overload when motoring and DC link voltage dip.
- infeed: Short-circuit currents at power-up due to the missing line reactor.
- power cables are not correctly connected.
- the power cables exceed the maximum permissible length.
- power unit defective.
- line phase interrupted.
Additional causes for a parallel switching device (r0108.15 = 1):
- a power unit has tripped (powered down) due to a ground fault.
- the closed-loop circulating current control is either too slow or has been set too fast.
Fault value (r0949, interpret bitwise binary):
Bit 0: Phase U.
Bit 1: Phase V.
Bit 2: Phase W.
Bit 3: Overcurrent in the DC link.
Note:
Fault value = 0 means that the phase with overcurrent is not recognized (e.g. for blocksize device).
Remedy: - check the motor data - if required, carry out commissioning.
- check the motor circuit configuration (star/delta).
- U/f operation: Increase up ramp.
- U/f operation: Check the assignment of the rated currents of the motor and Motor Module.
- infeed: Check the line supply quality.
- infeed: Reduce the motor load.
- infeed: Check the correct connection of the line filter and the line commutating reactor.
- check the power cable connections.
- check the power cables for short-circuit or ground fault.
- check the length of the power cables.
- replace power unit.
- check the line supply phases.
For a parallel switching device (r0108.15 = 1) the following additionally applies:
- check the ground fault monitoring thresholds (p0287).
- check the setting of the closed-loop circulating current control (p7036, p7037).

Cause: The Thyristor Control Board (TCB) of the Basic Line Module signals a fault.
- there is no line supply voltage.
- the line contactor is not closed.
- the line supply voltage is too low.
- line supply frequency outside the permissible range (45 ... 66 Hz).
- there is a DC link short-circuit.
- there is a DC link short-circuit (during the pre-charging phase).
- voltage supply for the Thyristor Control Board outside the nominal range (5 ... 18 V) and line voltage >30 V.
- there is an internal fault in the Thyristor Control Board.
Remedy: The faults must be saved in the Thyristor Control Board and must be acknowledged. To do this, the supply voltage of the
Thyristor Control Board must be switched out for at least 10 s!
- check the line supply voltage
- check or energize the line contactor.

Reaction: OFF2 (OFF1)
Acknowledge: IMMEDIATELY
Cause: At the power unit, the DC link voltage ripple has exceeded the permissible limit value.
Possible causes:
- A line phase has failed.
- The 3 line phases are inadmissibly unsymmetrical.
- The capacitance of the DC link capacitor forms a resonance frequency with the line inductance and the reactor integrated
in the power unit.
- the fuse of a phase of a main circuit has ruptured.
- A motor phase has failed.
Fault value (r0949, interpret decimal):
Only for internal Siemens troubleshooting.
Remedy: - check the main circuit fuses.
- Check whether a single-phase load is distorting the line voltages.
- Detune the resonant frequency with the line inductance by using an upstream line reactor.
- Dampen the resonant frequency with the line inductance by switching over the DC link voltage compensation in the
software (see p1810) – or increase the smoothing (see p1806). However, this can have a negative impact on the torque
ripple at the motor output.
- check the motor feeder cables.

Cause: The hardware current limitation in the relevant phase (see A30031, A30032, A30033) has responded too often. The number
of times the limit has been exceeded depends on the design and type of power unit.
For infeed units, the following applies:
- closed-loop control is incorrectly parameterized.
- load on the infeed is too high.
- Voltage Sensing Module incorrectly connected.
- line reactor missing or the incorrect type.
- power unit defective.
The following applies to Motor Modules:
- closed-loop control is incorrectly parameterized.
- fault in the motor or in the power cables.
- the power cables exceed the maximum permissible length.
- motor load too high
- power unit defective.
Fault value (r0949, interpret binary):
Bit 0: Phase U
Bit 1: Phase V

1) There is no line supply voltage connected.
2) The line contactor/line side switch has not been closed.
3) The line supply voltage is too low.
4) Line supply voltage incorrectly set (p0210).
5) The pre-charging resistors are overheated as there were too many pre-charging operations per time unit.
6) The pre-charging resistors are overheated as the DC link capacitance is too high.
7) The pre-charging resistors are overheated because when there is no "ready for operation" (r0863.0) of the infeed unit,
power is taken from the DC link.
8) The pre-charging resistors are overheated as the line contactor was closed during the DC link fast discharge through
the Braking Module.
9) The DC link has either a ground fault or a short-circuit.

Remedy: In general:
- check the line supply voltage at the input terminals.
- check the line supply voltage setting (p0210).
For booksize drive units, the following applies:
- wait (approx. 8 minutes) until the pre-charging resistors have cooled down. For this purpose, preferably disconnect the
infeed unit from the line supply.
Re 5):
- carefully observe the permissible pre-charging frequency (refer to the appropriate Equipment Manual).
Re 6):
- check the total capacitance of the DC link and reduce in accordance with the maximum permissible DC-link capacitance
if necessary (refer to the appropriate Equipment Manual)
Re 7):
- interconnect the ready-for-operation signal from the infeed unit (r0863.0) in the enable logic of the drives connected to
this DC link
Re 8):
- check the connections of the external line contactor. The line contactor must be open during DC-link fast discharge.
Re 9):
- check the DC link for ground faults or short circuits.
Re 11):
- Check the DC link voltage of the infeed (r0070) and Motor Modules (r0070).
If the DC link voltage generated by the infeed (or external) is not displayed for the Motor Modules (r0070), then a fuse has
ruptured in the Motor Module.

Cause: When cross-comparing the two monitoring channels, the drive detected a difference between the input data or results of
the monitoring functions and initiated a STOP F. One of the monitoring functions no longer reliably functions - i.e. safe
operation is no longer possible.
If at least one monitoring function is active, then after the parameterized timer has expired, the message C30701 "SI
Motion: STOP B initiated" is output. The message is output with message value 1031 when the Sensor Module hardware
is replaced.
The following message values may also occur in the following cases if the cause that is explicitly mentioned does not apply:
- differently parameterized cycle times (p9500/p9300, p9511/p9311).
- excessively fast cycle times (p9500/p9300, p9511/p9311).

Message value: %1
Drive object: HLA, HLA_840, SERVO, SERVO_840, SERVO_AC, VECTOR, VECTOR_AC
Reaction: NONE
Acknowledge: IMMEDIATELY (POWER ON)
Cause: When cross checking and comparing the two monitoring channels, the drive detected a difference between parameters
or results of the F-IO processing and initiated a STOP F. One of the monitoring functions no longer reliably functions - i.e.
safe operation is no longer possible.
The safety message C30711 with message value 0 is also displayed due to initiation of STOP F.
If at least one monitoring function is active, the safety message C30701 "SI Motion: STOP B initiated" is output after the
parameterized timer has expired.
Message value (r9749, interpret decimal):

230770 <location>SI Motion P2: Discrepancy error of the fail-safe inputs/outputs
Message value: %1
Drive object: SERVO, SERVO_AC, VECTOR, VECTOR_AC
Reaction: NONE
Acknowledge: IMMEDIATELY (POWER ON)
Cause: The fail-safe digital inputs/digital outputs (F-DI/F-DO) show a different state longer than that parameterized in p10002 /
p10102.
Fault value (r0949, interpret hexadecimal):
yyyyxxxx hex
xxxx: Discrepancy error for fail-safe digital inputs (F-DI).
Bit 0: Discrepancy error for F-DI 0
Bit 1: Discrepancy error for F-DI 1
...
yyyy: Discrepancy error for fail-safe digital outputs (F-DO).
Bit 0: Discrepancy error for F-DO 0
...
Note:
If several discrepancy errors occur consecutively, then this message is only signaled for the first error that occurs.
Remedy: - check the wiring of the F-DI (contact problems).
Note:
This message can be acknowledged via F-DI or PROFIsafe.
Discrepancy errors of an F-DI can only be completely acknowledged if safe acknowledgement was carried out once the
cause of the error was resolved (p10006 or acknowledgment via PROFIsafe). As long as safety acknowledgement was
not carried out, the corresponding F-DI stays in the safe state internally.
For cyclic switching operations at the F-DI, it may be necessary to adapt the discrepancy time to the switching frequency.
If the period of a cyclic switching pulse corresponds to twice the value of p10002, then the following formulas should be
checked:
- p10002 < (tp / 2) - td (discrepancy time must be less than half the period minus the actual discrepancy time)
- p10002 >= p9500 (discrepancy time must be no less than p9500)
- p10002 > td (discrepancy time must be greater than the switch discrepancy time which may actually apply)
td = possible actual discrepancy time (in ms) that can occur with a switching operation. This must correspond to at least
1 SI monitoring cycle (see p9500).
tp = period for a switching operation in ms.
When debounce p10017 is active, the discrepancy time is directly specified by the debounce time.
If the period of a cyclic switching pulse corresponds to twice the debounce time, then the following formulas should be
checked.
- p10002 < p10017 + 1 ms - td
- p10002 > td
- p10002 >= p9500
Example:
For a 12 ms SI monitoring cycle and a switching frequency of 110 ms (p10017 = 0), the maximum discrepancy time which
can be set is as follows:
p10002 <= (110/2 ms) - 12 ms = 43 ms
Rounded-off, p10002 <= 36 ms is obtained (since the discrepancy time can only be accepted as a whole SI monitoring
cycle, the value will need to be rounded up or down to a whole SI monitoring cycle if the result is not an exact multiple of
an SI monitoring cycle).

Example:
Fault F01773 (CU) is signaled with fault value = 0001_0127 and fault F30773 (MM) is signaled with fault value 0000_0127.
This means that in state 7 (Z = 7) the state of the external readback signal was not set correctly (Y = 2) after DO-0 (X =
1) was switched to ON/ON.
Fault value 0001_0127 indicates that 0 was expected (W = 0) and 1 (V = 1) was read back from the hardware.
Fault value 0000_0127 on the MM indicates that the states were as expected.
In the case of fault F30773, W and V are always identical; a value of 0 always means that 0 was expected at the readback
input but was not present on the other channel (CU).
Remedy: Check the wiring of the F-DOs and restart the test stop.
Note:
The fault is withdrawn if the test stop is successfully completed.
In the event of multiple test stop faults, the first one that occurred is shown.
Once the test stop has been restarted the next queued test stop fault will be signaled (if there is one).

Acknowledge: PULSE INHIBIT
Cause: The measured zero mark distance does not correspond to the parameterized zero mark distance.
For distance-coded encoders, the zero mark distance is determined from zero marks detected pairs. This means that if a
zero mark is missing, depending on the pair generation, this cannot result in a fault and also has no effect in the system.
The zero mark distance for the zero mark monitoring is set in p0425 (rotary encoder) or p0424 (linear encoder).
Fault value (r0949, interpret decimal):
Last measured zero mark distance in increments (4 increments = 1 encoder pulse).
The sign designates the direction of motion when detecting the zero mark distance.
See also: p0491
Remedy: - check that the encoder cables are routed in compliance with EMC.
- check the plug connections.
- check the encoder type (encoder with equidistant zero marks).
- adapt the parameter for the distance between zero marks (p0424, p0425).
- if message output above speed threshold, reduce filter time if necessary (p0438).

in an angular range of +/-60 ° electrical.
Fault value (r0949, interpret hexadecimal):
yyyyxxxx hex
yyyy: Determined mechanical zero mark position (can only be used for track C/D).
xxxx: Deviation of the zero mark from the expected position as electrical angle.
Scaling: 32768 dec = 180 °
See also: p0491
Remedy: - Check p0431 and, if necessary, correct (trigger via p1990 = 1 if necessary).
- check that the encoder cables are routed in compliance with EMC.
- check the plug connections.
- if the Hall sensor is used as an equivalent for track C/D, check the connection.
- Check the connection of track C or D.
- replace the encoder or encoder cable.

Cause: Absolute encoder:
When cyclically reading the absolute position, an excessively high difference to the incremental position was detected.
The absolute position that was read is rejected.
Limit value for the deviation:
- EnDat encoder: Is supplied from the encoder and is a minimum of 2 quadrants (e.g. EQI 1325 > 2 quadrants, EQN 1325
> 50 quadrants).
- other encoders: 15 pulses = 60 quadrants.
Incremental encoder:
When the zero pulse is passed, a deviation in the incremental position was detected.
For equidistant zero marks, the following applies:
- The first zero mark passed supplies the reference point for all subsequent checks. The other zero marks must have n
times the distance referred to the first zero mark.
For distance-coded zero marks, the following applies:
- the first zero mark pair supplies the reference point for all subsequent checks. The other zero mark pairs must have the
expected distance to the first zero mark pair.
Fault value (r0949, interpret decimal):
Deviation in quadrants (1 pulse = 4 quadrants).
See also: p0491
Remedy: - check that the encoder cables are routed in compliance with EMC.
- check the plug connections.
- replace the encoder or encoder cable.
- check whether the coding disk is dirty or there are strong ambient magnetic fields.
- adapt the parameter for the clearance between zero marks (p0425).
- if message output above speed threshold, reduce filter time if necessary (p0438).

Cause: The measured zero mark distance does not correspond to the parameterized zero mark distance.
For distance-coded encoders, the zero mark distance is determined from zero marks detected pairs. This means that if a
zero mark is missing, depending on the pair generation, this cannot result in a fault and also has no effect in the system.
The zero mark distance for the zero mark monitoring is set in p0425 (rotary encoder) or p0424 (linear encoder).
Alarm value (r2124, interpret decimal):
Last measured zero mark distance in increments (4 increments = 1 encoder pulse).
The sign designates the direction of motion when detecting the zero mark distance.
Remedy: - check that the encoder cables are routed in compliance with EMC.
- check the plug connections.
- check the encoder type (encoder with equidistant zero marks).
- adapt the parameter for the distance between zero marks (p0424, p0425).
- replace the encoder or encoder cable.

Reaction: NONE
Acknowledge: NONE
Cause: For the actual value sensing, an error was detected. As a result of this error, it must be assumed that the actual value
sensing supplies an incorrect coarse position.
Alarm value (r2124, interpret decimal):
3: The absolute position of the serial protocol and track A/B differ by half an encoder pulse. The absolute position must
have its zero position in the quadrants in which both tracks are negative. In the case of a fault, the position can be incorrect
by one encoder pulse.
Remedy: Re alarm value = 3:
- For a standard encoder with cable, contact the manufacturer where relevant.
- correct the assignment of the tracks to the position value that is serially transferred. To do this, the two tracks must be
connected, inverted, at the Sensor Module (interchange A with A* and B with B*) or, for a programmable encoder, check
the zero offset of the position.

Cause: The measured zero mark distance does not correspond to the parameterized zero mark distance.
This alarm is triggered with active square-wave encoder PPR correction and re-parameterized fault 31131 if the
accumulator contains larger values than p4683 or p4684.
The zero mark distance for zero mark monitoring is set in p0425 (rotary encoder).
Alarm value (r2124, interpret decimal):

Cause: The error for track C/D is greater than +/-15 ° mechanical or +/-60 ° electrical or the error for the Hall signals is greater
than +/-60 ° electrical.
One period of track C/D corresponds to 360 ° mechanical.
One period of the Hall signal corresponds to 360 ° electrical.
The monitoring responds if, for example, Hall sensors are connected as equivalent for the C/D tracks with the incorrect
rotational sense or supply values that are not accurate enough.
Alarm value (r2124, interpret decimal):
For track C/D, the following applies:
Measured deviation as mechanical angle (16 bits with sign, 182 dec corresponds to 1 °).
For Hall signals, the following applies:
Measured deviation as electrical angle (16 bits with sign, 182 dec corresponds to 1 °).
See also: p0491
Remedy: - track C or D not connected.
- correct the direction of rotation of the Hall sensor possibly connected as equivalent for track C/D.
- check that the encoder cables are routed in compliance with EMC.

Cause: When the zero pulse is passed, a deviation in the incremental position was detected.
For equidistant zero marks, the following applies:
- The first zero mark passed supplies the reference point for all subsequent checks. The other zero marks must have n
times the distance referred to the first zero mark.
For distance-coded zero marks, the following applies:
- the first zero mark pair supplies the reference point for all subsequent checks. The other zero mark pairs must have the
expected distance to the first zero mark pair.

Cause: For a configured linear axis without modulo correction, the drive/encoder has exceeded the maximum possible traversing
range. The value should be read in p0412 and interpreted as the number of motor revolutions.
For p0411.0 = 1, the maximum traversing range for the configured linear axis is defined to be 64x (+/- 32x) of p0421.
For p0411.3 = 1, the maximum traversing range for the configured linear axis is pre-set (default value) to the highest

- select encoder commissioning (p0010 = 4).
- reset the position tracking as follows (p0411.2 = 1).
- de-select encoder commissioning (p0010 = 0).

SERVO_840, SERVO_AC, TM41, VECTOR, VECTOR_AC
Reaction: NONE
Acknowledge: NONE
Cause: The serial number of the motor encoder of a synchronous motor has changed. The change was only checked for encoders
with serial number (e.g. EnDat encoders) and build-in motors (e.g. p0300 = 401) or third-party motors (p0300 = 2).
Cause 1:
- The encoder was replaced.
Cause 2:
- A third-party, built-in or linear motor was re-commissioned.
Cause 3:
- The motor with integrated and adjusted encoder was replaced.
Cause 4:
- The firmware was updated to a version that checks the encoder serial number.
Note:
With closed-loop position control, the serial number is accepted when starting the adjustment (p2507 = 2).
When the encoder is adjusted (p2507 = 3), the serial number is checked for changes and if required, the adjustment is
reset (p2507 = 1).
Proceed as follows to hide serial number monitoring:
- set the following serial numbers for the corresponding Encoder Data Set: p0441= FF, p0442 = 0, p0443 = 0, p0444 = 0,
p0445 = 0.
- parameterize F07414 as message type N (p2118, p2119).
See also: p0491
Remedy: Re causes 1, 2:
Carry out an automatic adjustment using the pole position identification routine. Acknowledge fault. Initiate the pole position
identification routine with p1990 = 1. Then check that the pole position identification routine is correctly executed.
SERVO:
If a pole position identification technique is selected in p1980, and if p0301 does not contain a motor type with an encoder
adjusted in the factory, then p1990 is automatically activated.
or
Set the adjustment via p0431. In this case, the new serial number is automatically accepted.
or
Mechanically adjust the encoder. Accept the new serial number with p0440 = 1.
Re causes 3, 4:
Accept the new serial number with p0440 = 1.

Acknowledge: PULSE INHIBIT
Cause: The measured zero mark distance does not correspond to the parameterized zero mark distance.
For distance-coded encoders, the zero mark distance is determined from zero marks detected pairs. This means that if a
zero mark is missing, depending on the pair generation, this cannot result in a fault and also has no effect in the system.
The zero mark distance for the zero mark monitoring is set in p0425 (rotary encoder) or p0424 (linear encoder).
Fault value (r0949, interpret decimal):
Last measured zero mark distance in increments (4 increments = 1 encoder pulse).
The sign designates the direction of motion when detecting the zero mark distance.
Remedy: - check that the encoder cables are routed in compliance with EMC.
- check the plug connections.
- check the encoder type (encoder with equidistant zero marks).
- adapt the parameter for the distance between zero marks (p0424, p0425).

Vector: OFF1 (IASC/DCBRK, NONE, OFF2, OFF3)
Hla: OFF1 (NONE, OFF2, OFF3)
Acknowledge: IMMEDIATELY
Cause: The amplitude of the reference track signal (track R) does not lie within the tolerance bandwidth for encoder 2.
The fault can be initiated when the unipolar voltage level is exceeded (RP/RN) or if the differential amplitude is undershot.
Fault value (r0949, interpret hexadecimal):
yyyyxxxx hex: yyyy = 0, xxxx = Signal level, track R (16 bits with sign)
The response thresholds of the unipolar signal levels of the encoder are between < 1400 mV and > 3500 mV.
The response threshold for the differential signal level of the encoder is < -1600 mV.
A signal level of 500 mV peak value corresponds to the numerical value 5333 hex = 21299 dec.
Note:
The analog value of the amplitude error is not measured at the same time with the hardware fault output by the Sensor
Module.
The fault value can only be represented between -32768 ... 32767 dec (-770 ... 770 mV).
The signal level is not evaluated unless the following conditions are satisfied:
- Sensor Module properties available (r0459.31 = 1).
- Monitoring active (p0437.31 = 1).
Remedy: - check the speed range; frequency characteristic (amplitude characteristic) of the measuring equipment might not be
sufficient for the speed range
- check that the encoder cables and shielding are routed in compliance with EMC.
- check the plug connections and contacts of the encoder cable.
- check the encoder type (encoder with zero marks).
- check whether the zero mark is connected and the signal cables RP and RN have been connected correctly.
- replace the encoder cable.
- if the coding disk is soiled or the lighting aged, replace the encoder.

When cyclically reading the absolute position, an excessively high difference to the incremental position was detected.
The absolute position that was read is rejected.
Limit value for the deviation:
- EnDat encoder: Is supplied from the encoder and is a minimum of 2 quadrants (e.g. EQI 1325 > 2 quadrants, EQN 1325

For equidistant zero marks, the following applies:
- The first zero mark passed supplies the reference point for all subsequent checks. The other zero marks must have n
times the distance referred to the first zero mark.
For distance-coded zero marks, the following applies:
- the first zero mark pair supplies the reference point for all subsequent checks. The other zero mark pairs must have the

Acknowledge: NONE
Cause: The measured zero mark distance does not correspond to the parameterized zero mark distance.
For distance-coded encoders, the zero mark distance is determined from zero marks detected pairs. This means that if a
zero mark is missing, depending on the pair generation, this cannot result in a fault and also has no effect in the system.
The zero mark distance for the zero mark monitoring is set in p0425 (rotary encoder) or p0424 (linear encoder).
Alarm value (r2124, interpret decimal):
Last measured zero mark distance in increments (4 increments = 1 encoder pulse).
The sign designates the direction of motion when detecting the zero mark distance.
Remedy: - check that the encoder cables are routed in compliance with EMC.
- check the plug connections.
- check the encoder type (encoder with equidistant zero marks).
- adapt the parameter for the distance between zero marks (p0424, p0425).

Message value: %1
Drive object: HLA, HLA_840, SERVO, SERVO_840, SERVO_AC, VECTOR, VECTOR_AC
Reaction: NONE
Acknowledge: NONE
Cause: The amplitude/phase/offset correction for track A or B is at the limit.
Amplitude error correction: Amplitude B / Amplitude A = 0.78 ... 1.27
Phase: <84 degrees or >96 degrees
SMC20: Offset correction: +/-140 mV
SMC10: Offset correction: +/-650 mV
Alarm value (r2124, interpret hexadecimal):

- replace the encoder or encoder cable.
232421 <location>Encoder 2: Coarse position error
Message value: %1
Drive object: HLA, HLA_840, SERVO, SERVO_840, SERVO_AC, VECTOR, VECTOR_AC
Reaction: NONE
Acknowledge: NONE
Cause: For the actual value sensing, an error was detected. As a result of this error, it must be assumed that the actual value
sensing supplies an incorrect coarse position.
Alarm value (r2124, interpret decimal):
3: The absolute position of the serial protocol and track A/B differ by half an encoder pulse. The absolute position must
have its zero position in the quadrants in which both tracks are negative. In the case of a fault, the position can be incorrect
by one encoder pulse.
Remedy: Re alarm value = 3:
- For a standard encoder with cable, contact the manufacturer where relevant.
- correct the assignment of the tracks to the position value that is serially transferred. To do this, the two tracks must be
connected, inverted, at the Sensor Module (interchange A with A* and B with B*) or, for a programmable encoder, check
the zero offset of the position.

Message value: %1
Drive object: HLA, HLA_840, SERVO, SERVO_840, SERVO_AC, VECTOR, VECTOR_AC
Reaction: NONE
Acknowledge: NONE
Cause: The measured zero mark distance does not correspond to the parameterized zero mark distance.
This alarm is triggered with active square-wave encoder PPR correction and re-parameterized fault 31131 if the
accumulator contains larger values than p4683 or p4684.
The zero mark distance for zero mark monitoring is set in p0425 (rotary encoder).
Alarm value (r2124, interpret decimal):
accumulated differential pulses in encoder pulses.
Remedy: - check that the encoder cables are routed in compliance with EMC.
- check the plug connections.
- check the encoder type (encoder with equidistant zero marks).
- adapt the parameter for the distance between zero marks (p0424, p0425).
- replace the encoder or encoder cable.

Message value: %1
Drive object: HLA, HLA_840, SERVO, SERVO_840, SERVO_AC, VECTOR, VECTOR_AC
Reaction: NONE
Acknowledge: NONE
Cause: The error for track C/D is greater than +/-15 ° mechanical or +/-60 ° electrical or the error for the Hall signals is greater
than +/-60 ° electrical.
One period of track C/D corresponds to 360 ° mechanical.
One period of the Hall signal corresponds to 360 ° electrical.
The monitoring responds if, for example, Hall sensors are connected as equivalent for the C/D tracks with the incorrect
rotational sense or supply values that are not accurate enough.
Alarm value (r2124, interpret decimal):
For track C/D, the following applies:
Measured deviation as mechanical angle (16 bits with sign, 182 dec corresponds to 1 °).
For Hall signals, the following applies:
Measured deviation as electrical angle (16 bits with sign, 182 dec corresponds to 1 °).
Remedy: - track C or D not connected.
- correct the direction of rotation of the Hall sensor possibly connected as equivalent for track C/D.
- check that the encoder cables are routed in compliance with EMC.
- check the adjustment of the Hall sensor.

1194 Diagnostics Manual, 01/2015, 6FC5398-6BP40-5BA2
Cause: When the zero pulse is passed, a deviation in the incremental position was detected.
For equidistant zero marks, the following applies:
- The first zero mark passed supplies the reference point for all subsequent checks. The other zero marks must have n
times the distance referred to the first zero mark.
For distance-coded zero marks, the following applies:
- the first zero mark pair supplies the reference point for all subsequent checks. The other zero mark pairs must have the
expected distance to the first zero mark pair.
Alarm value (r2124, interpret decimal):
Deviation in quadrants (1 pulse = 4 quadrants).
Remedy: - check that the encoder cables are routed in compliance with EMC.
- check the plug connections.
- replace the encoder or encoder cable.
- Clean coding disk or remove strong magnetic fields.

Cause: For track A/B, pulses have been lost or too many have been counted. These pulses are presently being corrected.
Alarm value (r2124, interpret decimal):
Last measured deviation of zero mark in increments (4 increments = 1 encoder pulse).
The sign designates the direction of motion when detecting the zero mark distance.
Remedy: - check that the encoder cables are routed in compliance with EMC.
- check the plug connections.
- replace the encoder or encoder cable.
- check encoder limit frequency.
- adapt the parameter for the distance between zero marks (p0424, p0425).

Reaction: OFF1 (NONE, OFF2, OFF3)
Acknowledge: IMMEDIATELY
Cause: For a configured linear axis without modulo correction, the drive/encoder has exceeded the maximum possible traversing
range. The value should be read in p0412 and interpreted as the number of motor revolutions.
For p0411.0 = 1, the maximum traversing range for the configured linear axis is defined to be 64x (+/- 32x) of p0421.
For p0411.3 = 1, the maximum traversing range for the configured linear axis is pre-set (default value) to the highest
possible value and is +/-p0412/2 (rounded off to complete revolutions). The highest possible value depends on the pulse
number (p0408) and the fine resolution (p0419).

1216 Diagnostics Manual, 01/2015, 6FC5398-6BP40-5BA2
Cause: The measured zero mark distance does not correspond to the parameterized zero mark distance.
For distance-coded encoders, the zero mark distance is determined from zero marks detected pairs. This means that if a
zero mark is missing, depending on the pair generation, this cannot result in a fault and also has no effect in the system.
The zero mark distance for the zero mark monitoring is set in p0425 (rotary encoder) or p0424 (linear encoder).
Fault value (r0949, interpret decimal):
Last measured zero mark distance in increments (4 increments = 1 encoder pulse).
The sign designates the direction of motion when detecting the zero mark distance.
Remedy: - check that the encoder cables are routed in compliance with EMC.
- check the plug connections.
- check the encoder type (encoder with equidistant zero marks).
- adapt the parameter for the distance between zero marks (p0424, p0425).
- if message output above speed threshold, reduce filter time if necessary (p0438).
- replace the encoder or encoder cable.

Cause: The 1.5 x parameterized zero mark distance was exceeded.
The zero mark distance for the zero mark monitoring is set in p0425 (rotary encoder) or p0424 (linear encoder).
Fault value (r0949, interpret decimal):
Number of increments after POWER ON or since the last zero mark that was detected (4 increments = 1 encoder pulse).
Remedy: - check that the encoder cables are routed in compliance with EMC.
- check the plug connections.
- check the encoder type (encoder with equidistant zero marks).
- adapt the parameter for the clearance between zero marks (p0425).
- if message output above speed threshold, reduce filter time if necessary (p0438).

Cause: The amplitude of the reference track signal (track R) does not lie within the tolerance bandwidth for encoder 3.
The fault can be initiated when the unipolar voltage level is exceeded (RP/RN) or if the differential amplitude is undershot.
Fault value (r0949, interpret hexadecimal):
yyyyxxxx hex: yyyy = 0, xxxx = Signal level, track R (16 bits with sign)
The response thresholds of the unipolar signal levels of the encoder are between < 1400 mV and > 3500 mV.
The response threshold for the differential signal level of the encoder is < -1600 mV.
A signal level of 500 mV peak value corresponds to the numerical value 5333 hex = 21299 dec.
Note:
The analog value of the amplitude error is not measured at the same time with the hardware fault output by the Sensor
Module.
The fault value can only be represented between -32768 ... 32767 dec (-770 ... 770 mV).
The signal level is not evaluated unless the following conditions are satisfied:
- Sensor Module properties available (r0459.31 = 1).
- Monitoring active (p0437.31 = 1).
Remedy: - check the speed range; frequency characteristic (amplitude characteristic) of the measuring equipment might not be
sufficient for the speed range
- check that the encoder cables and shielding are routed in compliance with EMC.
- check the plug connections and contacts of the encoder cable.
- check the encoder type (encoder with zero marks).
- check whether the zero mark is connected and the signal cables RP and RN have been connected correctly.
- replace the encoder cable.
- if the coding disk is soiled or the lighting aged, replace the encoder.

Cause: The error for track C/D is greater than +/-15 ° mechanical or +/-60 ° electrical or the error for the Hall signals is greater
than +/-60 ° electrical.
One period of track C/D corresponds to 360 ° mechanical.
One period of the Hall signal corresponds to 360 ° electrical.
The monitoring responds if, for example, Hall sensors are connected as equivalent for the C/D tracks with the incorrect
rotational sense or supply values that are not accurate enough.
After the fine synchronization using one reference mark or 2 reference marks for distance-coded encoders, this fault is no
longer initiated, but instead, Alarm A33429.
Fault value (r0949, interpret decimal):
For track C/D, the following applies:
Measured deviation as mechanical angle (16 bits with sign, 182 dec corresponds to 1 °).
For Hall signals, the following applies:
Measured deviation as electrical angle (16 bits with sign, 182 dec corresponds to 1 °).
Remedy: - track C or D not connected.
- correct the direction of rotation of the Hall sensor possibly connected as equivalent for track C/D.
- check that the encoder cables are routed in compliance with EMC.
- check the adjustment of the Hall sensor.

Cause: After initializing the pole position using track C/D, Hall signals or pole position identification routine, the zero mark was
detected outside the permissible range. For distance-coded encoders, the test is carried out after passing 2 zero marks.
Fine synchronization was not carried out.
When initializing via track C/D (p0404) then it is checked whether the zero mark occurs in an angular range of +/-18 °
mechanical.
When initializing via Hall sensors (p0404) or pole position identification (p1982) it is checked whether the zero mark occurs
in an angular range of +/-60 ° electrical.
Fault value (r0949, interpret hexadecimal):
yyyyxxxx hex
yyyy: Determined mechanical zero mark position (can only be used for track C/D).
xxxx: Deviation of the zero mark from the expected position as electrical angle.

Remedy: - check that the encoder cables are routed in compliance with EMC.
- check the plug connections.
- if the Hall sensor is used as an equivalent for track C/D, check the connection.
- Check the connection of track C or D.
- replace the encoder or encoder cable.

Cause: Absolute encoder:
When cyclically reading the absolute position, an excessively high difference to the incremental position was detected.
The absolute position that was read is rejected.
Limit value for the deviation:
- EnDat encoder: Is supplied from the encoder and is a minimum of 2 quadrants (e.g. EQI 1325 > 2 quadrants, EQN 1325
> 50 quadrants).
- other encoders: 15 pulses = 60 quadrants.
Incremental encoder:
When the zero pulse is passed, a deviation in the incremental position was detected.
For equidistant zero marks, the following applies:
- The first zero mark passed supplies the reference point for all subsequent checks. The other zero marks must have n
times the distance referred to the first zero mark.
For distance-coded zero marks, the following applies:
- the first zero mark pair supplies the reference point for all subsequent checks. The other zero mark pairs must have the
expected distance to the first zero mark pair.
Fault value (r0949, interpret decimal):
Deviation in quadrants (1 pulse = 4 quadrants).
Remedy: - check that the encoder cables are routed in compliance with EMC.
- check the plug connections.
- replace the encoder or encoder cable.
- check whether the coding disk is dirty or there are strong ambient magnetic fields.
- adapt the parameter for the clearance between zero marks (p0425).
- if message output above speed threshold, reduce filter time if necessary (p0438).

Cause: For the actual value sensing, an error was detected. As a result of this error, it must be assumed that the actual value
sensing supplies an incorrect coarse position.
Alarm value (r2124, interpret decimal):
3: The absolute position of the serial protocol and track A/B differ by half an encoder pulse. The absolute position must
have its zero position in the quadrants in which both tracks are negative. In the case of a fault, the position can be incorrect
by one encoder pulse.
Remedy: Re alarm value = 3:
- For a standard encoder with cable, contact the manufacturer where relevant.
- correct the assignment of the tracks to the position value that is serially transferred. To do this, the two tracks must be
connected, inverted, at the Sensor Module (interchange A with A* and B with B*) or, for a programmable encoder, check
the zero offset of the position.

SINAMICS alarms
Alarms
Diagnostics Manual, 01/2015, 6FC5398-6BP40-5BA2 1245
Cause: The encoder serial number has changed. The change is only checked for encoders with serial number (e.g. EnDat
encoders).
- The encoder was replaced.
Note:
With closed-loop position control, the serial number is accepted when starting the adjustment (p2507 = 2).
When the encoder is adjusted (p2507 = 3), the serial number is checked for changes and if required, the adjustment is
reset (p2507 = 1).
Proceed as follows to hide serial number monitoring:
- set the following serial numbers for the corresponding Encoder Data Set: p0441= FF, p0442 = 0, p0443 = 0, p0444 = 0,
p0445 = 0.
Remedy: Mechanically adjust the encoder. Accept the new serial number with p0440 = 1.

As long as this fault is present, fail safe values are activated in TM54F. All the drives are not enabled.
Fault value (r0949, interpret binary):
If a bit is set in the range bit 0 ... 5, then the following applies:
The communication cycle specified in p10000[x] does not correspond with the monitoring cycle of the drive object which
was specified in p10010[x]. (if only p10000[0] used, then this value must be identical with all monitoring cycles of the drive

Bit 17 = 1 : p10000[1] has been selected too low.
..
Bit 21 = 1 : p10000[5] has been selected too low.
When using an axis with Basic Safety Functions with TM54F, then the monitoring cycle should be greater than 500us +
8*current controller clock cycles of the drive.
-this error is also signaled if a drive controlled with TM54F is parameterized so that the basic functions are controlled via
TM54F and simultaneously extended safety functions or ncSI have been parameterized.
- the following applies for fault value 0:
Since the firmware update of the TM54F it has not been switched off.
Or, the connected TM54F has firmware that is too old.
See also: p10010 (SI TM54F drive object assignment)
Remedy: For a fault value in the range from bit 0 ... 5:
- First check that all drives are entered in p10010,
extended safety functions or basic functions have been enabled via TM54F.
- Execute the copy function for TM54F(p9700 = 87).
- adapt the checksums for TM54F(p9701 = 172).
- copy RAM to ROM.
- carry out a POWER ON.
For a fault value in the range from bit 16 ... 21:
Increase the current controller sampling time of the corresponding drive, in order to avoid faults in operation.

Bit 0 = 1 : drive 1 error
Bit 1 = 1 : drive 2 error
Bit 2 = 1 : drive 3 error
Bit 3 = 1 : drive 4 error
Bit 4 = 1 : drive 5 error
Bit 5 = 1 : drive 6 error
Remedy: Carry out the safety commissioning of the drive involved and enable the safety functions for TM54F.
Then commission the TM54F and then just set p9700=87d and p9701=172d.

Cause: An error was detected when carrying out the test stop on the TM54F. Failsafe control signals (failsafe values) are transferred
to the safety functions.
Fault value (r0949, interpret hexadecimal):
aaaabbcc hex:
aaaa: DO or F-DI (dependent on test step cc), where the expected state was not assumed (bit 0 = F-DI 0 or F-DO 0, bit 1
= F-DI 1 or F-DO 1, etc.).
bb: Fault cause
bb = 01 hex: Internal fault.
bb = 02 hex: Fault when comparing the switching signals of the two channels (F-DI or DI).
bb = 03 hex: Internal fault.
bb = 04 hex: Fault when comparing the switching signals of the two channels (Diag-DO).
cc: State of the test stop in which the fault has occurred.
The display format is as follows:
Slave fault state: (test actions)(test actions) | corresponding step for the master: (test actions)(test actions) | Description
00 hex: (L1+OFF)(L2+ON) | 0A hex: ( )( ) | Synchronization / switching step

The expected states to be checked depend on the parameterized test mode (p10047).
The following expected states are tested in the test steps when testing the F-DOs:
The display format is as follows:
Test step (SL MA): Expected Diag-DO mode 1 | Expected DI 20 ... 23 mode 2 | Expected DI 20 ... 23 mode 3
(4C hex 57 hex): Diag-DO = 0 V | DI = 24 V | DI = 24 V
(62 hex 6D hex): Diag-DO = 0 V | DI = 0 V | DI = 0 V
(78 hex 83 hex): Diag-DO = 0 V | DI = 0 V | DI = 24 V
(8E hex 99 hex): Diag-DO = 24 V | DI = 0 V | DI = 24 V
(A4 hex AF hex): Diag-DO = 0 V | DI = 24 V | DI = 24 V
Example:
If an error with fault causes bb = 02 hex or 04 hex occurs in a test stop step, the test action for the fault took place in the
previous test stop step. The expected states are tested in the next step.
Master signals fault value 0001_04AF and slave signals fault value 0001_04A4.
aaaa = 1 --> F-DO 0 is involved.
bb = 04 hex --> the test of the Diag-DO was unsuccessful.
cc = The expected states were tested in test stop step AF on the master and A4 on the slave.
The expected state Diag-DO = 0 V was checked in the table, i.e. Diag-DO was at 0 V instead of the expected 24 V. The
associated test action took place in the previous step (99 hex DO OFF, A4 hex DO OFF). Both DOs were switched to OFF.

Remedy: Check the wiring of the F-DIs and F-DOs and restart the test stop.
Note:
The fault is withdrawn if the test stop is successfully completed.
For fault value = CCCCCCCC hex, DDDDDDDD hex, EEEEEEEE hex the following applies:
These fault values occur together with fault F35152. In this case, all parameters for the test stop should be checked.
You should also check whether the firmware version of the TM54F matches that of the Control Unit.
You also need to check p10001, p10017, p10046 and p10047.
A POWER ON must be carried out after correcting the parameters.

Cause: Cyclic communication of at least one drive with the Terminal Module 54F (TM54F) is not active.
Possible causes:
- at least one Motor Module/Hydraulic Module was replaced (e.g. hardware was replaced).
- The parameterization of theTM54F (p10010) is inconsistent with the number of drives, which have drive-based motion
monitoring functions activated with TM54F.
- For the signaled drive, it is not permissible that the "Safe motion monitoring without selection" (p9601.5 = 1) is
parameterized.
- And activated drive has no communication via DRIVE-CLiQ.
- p10010 of the TM54F master module is not the same as p10010 of the TM54F slave module (in this case, F35051 is
also output).
- In p10010 of the TM54F master or slave module, the number of a drive object was entered several times.
- the control of the Basis Functions via TM54F was parameterized, and simultaneously the Extended Safety Functions or
ncSI were parameterized.
Fault value (r0949, interpret binary):
yyyy yyyy xxxx xxxx bin
xxxx xxxx bin: inconsistent configuration
Bit 0 = 1: No communication with drive 1.
...
Bit 5 = 1: No communication with drive 6.
yyyy yyyy bin: Motor Module/Hydraulic Module replaced or a DRIVE-CLiQ cable of a Motor Module/Hydraulic Module not
inserted.
Bit 8 = 1: Motor Module/Hydraulic Module from drive 1 was replaced or does not communicate.
...
Bit 13 = 1: Motor Module/Hydraulic Module from drive 6 was replaced or does not communicate.
Note:
When this fault is present, none of the drives listed in the fault value, which have drive-based motion monitoring functions
operating with TM54F, are enabled.
For fault value = 0:
The number of drive objects specified in p10010 is not equal to the number of drives that have drive-based motion
monitoring functions that have been enabled.
See also: p10010 (SI TM54F drive object assignment)
Remedy: For all drive objects specified in p10010, check whether the drive-based motion monitoring functions with TM54F are
enabled (p9601).
Check as to whether F35051 is also output and remove the cause.
Check whether each drive object number is listed only once in the indices of p10010.
Note:
If a drive was deactivated and activated without first having established the DRIVE-CLiQ connection, then this alarm is
also output.
When replacing a Motor Module/Hydraulic Module, carry out the following steps:
- start the copy function for the node identifier on the TM54F (p9700 = 1D hex).
- acknowledge the hardware CRC on the TM54F (p9701 = EC hex).
- save all parameters (p0977 = 1).
- carry out a POWER ON (power off/on) for all components.
For SINUMERIK, the following applies:
HMI supports the replacement of components with Safety functions (operating area "Diagnostics" --> Softkey "Alarm list"
--> Softkey "Confirm SI HW" etc.).

Cause: A communication error between the TM54F master and Control Unit or between the TM54F slave and the Motor Module/
Hydraulic Module was detected.
Fault value (r0949, interpret hexadecimal):
Only for internal Siemens troubleshooting.
Remedy: When replacing a Motor Module/Hydraulic Module, carry out the following steps:
- start the copy function for the node identifier on the TM54F (p9700 = 1D hex).
- acknowledge the hardware CRC on the TM54F (p9701 = EC hex).
- save all parameters (p0977 = 1).
- carry out a POWER ON (power off/on) for all components.
The following always applies:
- check the electrical cabinet design and cable routing for EMC compliance
- upgrade the software on the TM54F.
- contact the Hotline.
- replace the TM54F.

Cause: The safety input terminals or output terminals show a different state longer than that parameterized in p10002.
Fault value (r0949, interpret hexadecimal):
yyyyxxxx hex
xxxx: The safety-relevant input terminals F-DI indicate a discrepancy.
Bit 0: Discrepancy for F-DI 0
...
Bit 9: Discrepancy for F-DI 9
yyyy: The safety-relevant output terminals F-DO indicate a discrepancy.
Bit 0: Discrepancy for F-DO 0
...
Bit 3: Discrepancy for F-DO 3
Note:
If several discrepancy errors occur consecutively, then this fault is only signaled for the first error that occurs.
The following options are available to analyze all of the discrepancy errors:
- Using the commissioning software, evaluate the input states and output states of the TM54F. All discrepancy errors are
displayed here.
- Compare parameters p10051 and p10052 from the TM54F master and TM54F slave for discrepancy.
Remedy: Check the wiring of the corresponding F-DI (contact problems).
Discrepancy errors in the fail-safe digital inputs (F-DI) can only be completely acknowledged if, after the cause of the error
was resolved, safe acknowledgement was carried out (see p10006). As long as safety acknowledgement was not carried
out, the corresponding F-DI stays in the safe state internally.
Sets the discrepancy time for cyclic switching operations at the F-DIs:
For cyclic switching operations at the fail-safe digital inputs (F-DI), it may be necessary to adapt the discrepancy time to
the switching frequency:
If the period of a cyclic switching pulse corresponds to twice the value of p10002, then the following formulas should be
checked:
- p10002 < (tp / 2) - td (discrepancy time must be less than half the period minus the actual discrepancy time)
- p10002 >= p10000 (discrepancy time must be no less than p10000)
- p10002 > td (discrepancy time must be greater than the switch discrepancy time which may actually apply)
td: possible actual discrepancy time (in ms) that can occur with a switching operation. This must correspond to at least 1
SI sampling cycle (see p10000).
tp: period for a switching operation in ms.
For cyclic switching operations and when debounce (p10017) is active, the discrepancy time is directly specified by the
debounce time.
If the period of a cyclic switching pulse corresponds to twice the debounce time, then the following formulas should be
checked.
- p10002 < p10017 + 1ms - td
- p10002 > td
- p10002 >= p10000
Example:
If the SI sampling cycle is 12 ms and the switching frequency is 110 ms (p10017 = 0), the maximum discrepancy time
which can be set is as follows:
p10002 <= 110/2 ms - 12 ms = 43 ms --> rounded-off, the following is obtained p10002 <= 36 ms
Since the discrepancy time can only be accepted as a whole SI sampling time, the value will need to be rounded up or
down to a whole SI sampling time value if it is not an exact integer multiple of an SI sampling time.
Basic secondary condition to set the discrepancy time:
The discrepancy time of the FDIs must always be set higher than the highest value p9780 (the drives that use safety with
TM54F).

Cause: The signals output from the Terminal Module 41 (TM41) for tracks A/B have reached the limit frequency. The output signals
are no longer in synchronism with the specified setpoint.
SIMOTION (p4400 = 0) operating mode:
- If the TM41 has been configured as the technology project, this fault is also output in response to short-circuited A/B
signals in X520.
SINAMICS (p4400 = 1) operating mode:
- the fine resolution of TM41 in p0418 does not match that of the connector input that was interconnected at p4420
- the encoder position actual value r0479 interconnected at connector input p4420 has an excessively high actual speed
- the output signals correspond to a speed, which is greater than the maximum speed (r1082 of TM41).
Remedy: SIMOTION (p4400 = 0) operating mode:
- enter a lower speed setpoint (p1155).
- reduce the encoder pulse number (p0408).

Cause: The zero mark synchronization with the encoder to be emulated was interrupted.
Alarm value (r2124, interpret decimal):
0: The encoder is not in the ready state (e.g. encoder parked)
1: An absolute encoder was connected.
2: The encoder r0479[0...2] interconnected via connector input: p4420 is already communicating with another TM41
(precisely one TM41 can be interconnected with a specific r0479[0...2]).
3: The BICO interconnection to Terminal Module 41 (TM41) was removed (CI: p4420 = 0 signal).
4: The encoder interconnected via connector input: p4420 has carried out an EDS changeover or has been reparameterized (this operation is not supported, set p4420 to 0 and interconnect again).
5: The maximum number of revolutions of the encoder was exceeded.
6: Encoder in an invalid state.
7: Encoder in an invalid state.
8: Encoder in an invalid state (the encoder is not parameterized or the interconnected signal source is not in the cyclic
state).
Remedy: Not necessary.
- if the encoder changes into the ready state, then a synchronization operation that was previously interrupted is carried
out again.
- if the synchronization was interrupted due to the maximum permissible synchronization duration, then a new
synchronization is not carried out.

TM41, VECTOR, VECTOR_AC
Reaction: NONE
Acknowledge: NONE
Cause: There is no frequency setpoint for the Terminal Module 41 (TM41). The output of tracks A/B has been held (frozen).
Possible causes:
- Connector input p4420 is not interconnected.
- the leading encoder is not in the "ready" state (parking encoder or encoder data set not parameterized).
- TM41 has a fault.
- The TM41 is in the commissioning mode (p0010 > 0).
- The TM41 component is not connected to DRIVE-CLiQ.
Remedy: - Appropriately interconnect connector input p4420.
- Bring the leading encoder into the "ready" state.
- Remove any TM41 faults.

Reaction: NONE
Acknowledge: NONE
Cause: Terminal Module 41 (TM41) does not support the following application cases:
- the encoder interconnected via connector input p4420 has carried out an EDS changeover.
- the encoder interconnected with the TM41 was re-parameterized so that the position actual value of the encoder must
be newly interpreted.
For example, this is the case when changing the direction of rotation of the motor (p0410, p1821) or when changing the
fine resolution (p0418). This may result in a sudden change in the position actual value of the encoder (position setpoint
of the TM41), which must not be output at the TM41.

Remedy: Set connector input p4420 = 0 and re-wire.
235228 <location>TM: Sampling time p4099[3] invalid

Reaction: NONE
Acknowledge: NONE
Cause: The sampling time set in p4099[3] for incremental encoder emulation in Terminal Module 41 (TM41) does not correspond
to the valid value. To resolve the problem, correct the setting of p4099[3]. The system automatically performs a warm
restart/sub-boot.
Alarm value (r2124, interpret decimal):
1:
A sampling time p4099[3] < 125 µs was set.
2:
An integer multiple of the DRIVE-CLiQ clock cycle was not entered in p4099[3].
3:
- In the SINAMICS mode (p4400 = 1), the sampling time in p4099[3] is not an integer multiple of the current controller
sampling time (p0115[0]) of the drive object, which supplies the position setpoint (CI: p4420) for the incremental encoder
simulation.
- The encoder interconnected via connector input p4420 (e.g. an SSI encoder) is sampled in a slower clock cycle.
Remedy: - if necessary, cancel the BICO interconnection via connector input p4420.
- check the rules specified under cause for setting the sampling time in p4099[3].
- if necessary, set the BICO interconnection via connector input p4420 again.
Note:
Every time the BICO interconnection is reset via connector input p4420, the sampling time is checked in p4099[3] and,
where necessary, this message is output.

Reaction: NONE
Acknowledge: NONE
Cause: The "master control by PLC" signal was missing in operation.
- interconnection of the binector input for "master control by PLC" is incorrect (p0854).
- the higher-level control has withdrawn the "master control by PLC" signal.
- data transfer via the fieldbus (master/drive) was interrupted.
Note:
This alarm is only decisive in the "SIMOTION" operating mode (p4400 = 0).
In the "SINAMICS" operating mode (p4400 = 1), the setpoints at p4420 are evaluated independent of binector input p0854.
Remedy: - check the interconnection of the binector input for "master control by PLC" (p0854).
- check the "master control by PLC" signal and, if required, switch in.
- check the data transfer via the fieldbus (master/drive).
- check the setting of parameter p2037.

1296 Diagnostics Manual, 01/2015, 6FC5398-6BP40-5BA2
Cause: SINAMICS (p4400 = 1) operating mode:
When parameterizing a Terminal Module 41 (TM41) or when operating a TM41 Module, an operating state was reached
which required a POWER ON.
These include:
- changing the encoder pulse number (p0408).
- changing the fine resolution (p0418).
- withdrawing the DRIVE-CLiQ cable without first de-activating TM41 via p0105.
If this alarm was output, then the zero mark of the TM41 can no longer be output in synchronism to that of the encoder
interconnected at p4420.
SIMOTION (p4400 = 0) operating mode:
A previously set zero mark position (p4426) no longer matches encoder position (r0479) due to the change in the pulse
number (p0408).
Remedy: The incremental position at output X520 of TM41 can still be evaluated independent of the zero mark.
A POWER ON must be carried out if the TM41 zero mark is evaluated.

Cause: A function requested by the Control Unit is not supported by a DRIVE-CLiQ component.
Fault value (r0949, interpret decimal):
1: Terminal Module 31 does not support the function "Timer for temperature evaluation" (X522.7/8, p4103 > 0.000).
4: The improved actual value resolution is not supported (p4401.4).
5: The improved setpoint resolution is not supported (p4401.5).
6: The residual value handling in the setpoint channel cannot be deactivated (p4401.6).
7: Output frequencies greater than 750 kHz cannot be activated (p4401.7).
Remedy: For fault value = 1:
- De-activate timer for temperature evaluation (X522.7/8) (p4103 = 0.000).
- Use Terminal Module 31 and the relevant firmware version to enable the "Timer for temperature evaluation" function
(Order No. 6SL3055-0AA00-3AA1, firmware version 2.6 and higher).

Remedy: Remedy for 1-11
1. Check the control project, check MD11240 $MN_PROFIBUS_SDB_NUMBER, and reload it when using a user-specific
SDB.
2. If the error still occurs, back up data, and restart the control with the standard values as per the as-delivered condition.
3. In case of correct ramp-up, reload the user data stage by stage.
4. If the error still occurs during ramp-up with standard values, reboot the system from the PC card or update the software.
5. If the error still occurs, replace the hardware.
Remedy for 20-21
1. Check/correct the addresses of the connected slaves/devices.
Remedy for 22
See SINAMICS warning 1903 for a description of the meaning behind the error codes.
1. Control the SDB
- Check the type and length of the message frame
- Match slot assignment with P978
2. Evaluate the drive alarms/warnings
Remedy for 23-24
1. Software replacement required
Remedy for 25
1. Change the message frame type
2. Reduce the number of slots
3. Reduce the number of slaves/devices
4. Create a new SDB
5. Software must be replaced
If the error has still not been able to be rectified after this procedure, send the error text to the control manufacturer.

380005 PROFIBUS/PROFINET: Bus %3 access conflict, type %1, counter %2
Parameters: %1 = Conflict type
%2 = Serial number within a conflict sequence
%3 = Number of the affected bus
Explanation: An access conflict occurred on the PROFIBUS/PROFINET in cyclic mode: An attempt has been made in the NCK to write
data to the bus or to read from the bus while cyclic data transfer was active. This may lead to inconsistant data.
Type 1: NCK attempts to read data before the cyclic transfer has finished on the bus.
Type 2: The NCK has not finished writing its data when the cyclic transfer begins again. Counter %2 contains a serial
number starting at 1. A maximum of 10 alarms are output in succession. If no conflicts occur in a DP cycle, the counter is
reset and new alarms are output again on the next conflict.
Reaction: Alarm display.
Remedy: - Check the timing again, in particular ensure that the settings in MD10050 $MN_SYSCLOCK_CYCLE_TIME and MD10062
$MN_POSCTRL_CYCLE_DELAY are correct:
 MD10062 $MN_POSCTRL_CYCLE_DELAY must be larger for type 1.

380022 PROFIBUS/PROFINET: Configuration of DP master bus %1 has been changed
Parameters: %1 = Number of the affected bus
Explanation: The PROFIBUS configuration on the DP master was changed during operation, e.g. by downloading a new hardware
configuration via STEP 7. As the cycle data may also have changed, operation cannot be continued, and a warm start is
required.
If the master functionality is within the PLC (as on the 840Di), the PLC will have been stopped for the download, and alarm
2000 (PLC sign-of-life) output.

1376 Diagnostics Manual, 01/2015, 6FC5398-6BP40-5BA2
Explanation: The generation of the PROFIBUS/PROFINET in the SDB does not conform to the configuration specifications of the NC
in use.
Overview: Cause of the error, par 1:
- 01 = SDB contains slave/device without diagnostics slot, slave/device address
- 02 = SDB contains too many slot entries, identifier
- 03 = SDB contains no equidistance data, no function
- 04 = PNIO: SDB contains different Tdp (also TDC) on one device
- 05 = PNIO: SDB contains different Tmapc (also CACF) on one device
- 06 = PNIO: SDB contains different TI on one device
- 07 = PNIO: SDB contains different TO on one device
- 08 = PNIO: SDB contains device numbers that are too high (with values higher than 126)
- 09 = SDB content transferred segmented (too many slots/frames)
- 10 = Not enough memory space for segmented SDB content (too many slots/frames)
- 11 = The telegram configured in the SDB is too short for the selected telegram acc. to $MN_DRIVE_TELEGRAM_TYPE.
- 20 = SDB contains too many slaves/devices, quantity
- 21 = SDB missing or contains invalid data, error code
- 22 = SDB configuration data incorrect, slave/device address, error code
- 23 = Reserved
- 24 = Reserved
- 25 = Reserved
- 26 = Reserved
- 27 = Reserved
- 28 = Reserved
- 29 = Reserved
Reaction: Channel not ready.
NC Start disable in this channel.
Interface signals are set.
Alarm display.
Remedy: Check that the corresponding SDB:
- Contains a diagnostic slot for every slave/device
- Contains only slave/device entries relevant to the application
In principle, it is possible to include a superset of slaves/devices in the SDB that are partially relevant for different end
versions of the product. However, this overloads the NC memory and runtime capacity and should, therefore, always be
avoided.
If this alarm occurs, reduce the SDB to a minimum.
If the code for the error cause is 03, check that equidistance is activated in the SDB (e.g. using STEP 7 HW config).
If the code for the error cause is 10, reduce the number of slaves/slots on the bus concerned (e.g. using STEP 7 HW
config).
If the alarm continues to occur, please send the error text to the control system manufacturer.
If the code for the error cause is 11, select a larger telegram as appropriate using STEP 7 HW config or
select a smaller telegram under $MN_DRIVE_TELEGRAM_TYPE.

System responses 9
9.1 System reactions to SINUMERIK alarms
Response Effect
Correction block with reorganization Block preparation has detected an error, which can be corrected by modifying the
program. Reorganization is performed after a program modification.
Correction block Block preparation has detected an error, which can be corrected by modifying the
program.
NC switches into the tracking mode The axes follow-up.
Interpreter stop Program execution is canceled after all the prepared blocks (IPO buffer) have been
processed.
Local alarm response A local alarm response is output.
In the program code, individual actions can be executed, which are checked using
this response. For example, the block sequence is interrupted in preprocessing if
a compile cycle alarm appears with this response.
No alarm response No alarm response is initiated.
NC not ready NC ready is not set:
Active fast braking (i.e. with the maximum braking current) for all drives.
The controller enable for all NC axes is deleted.
NC ready relay contact drops out.
Mode group not ready Mode group ready is not set:
Active fast braking (i.e. with the maximum braking current) is realized for all drives
of this mode group.
The controller enable of the NC axes involved is deleted.
Channel not ready Channel ready is not set:
Active fast braking (i.e. with the maximum braking current) is realized for all drives
of this channel.
The controller enable of the NC axes involved is deleted.
NC start inhibit in this channel A program cannot be started in this channel.
Re-reference axes in this channel The axes in this channel have to be referenced again.
Interface signals are set A VDI interface signal alarm is set.
Alarm display The alarm is displayed at the user interface.
NC stop for alarm All channel are stopped using a ramp stop.
NC Stop for an alarm at end of block NC stops if the end of a block is reached.
Alarm reaction in automatic mode The alarm is displayed whenever bit 0 of machine data MD11411 $MN_ENA‐
BLE_ALARM_MASK is set.
The response is be set whenever an alarm should only occur during automatic
mode without manual operation by a user.
Message display The alarm is displayed when bit 1 of machine data MD11411 $MN_ENA‐
BLE_ALARM_MASK is set.
The message display is for alarms that are normally suppressed.

Response Effect
Mode group is not ready, is also effec‐
tive on individual axes
The NC ready is canceled in all mode groups.
As a consequence, the response corresponds to an "NC not ready" with the fol‐
lowing difference:
The "NC ready" is not withdrawn and the corresponding VDI bit is not set, e.g. for
Emergency Stop.
All channel-specific alarm reactions de‐
layed on alarm, alarm display
All responses are buffered on a channel-for-channel-specific basis from the incom‐
ing alarms and are therefore not active.
The alarms are displayed at the user interface.
The responses from the mode group and NC are transferred.
The delayed alarm responses are activated if the responses are deleted by an
activated internal NC code, or by the configured alarm response "Alarm response
delay is canceled".
All alarm responses are delayed by one
IPO cycle on alarm
All alarm responses are delayed by one cycle when an alarm is issued. This func‐
tionality is required as part of ESR development.
The alarm response delay is canceled The state of "All channel-specific alarm responses delayed on alarm, alarm display"
is canceled.
NC start inhibit in this channel, ASUB
starts, where relevant, are permitted
A program cannot be started in this channel. ASUBs, where relevant, are permitted.
